00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:35.882
<i>Come in close.</i>

00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:38.438
<i>Closer.</i>

00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:42.325
<i>Because the more you think, you see,</i>

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:44.760
<i>the easier it'll be to fool you.</i>

00:00:46.394 --> 00:00:48.283
<i>Because what is seeing?</i>

00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:52.399
<i>You're looking, but what you're really doing
is filtering, interpreting,</i>

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.442
<i>searching for meaning.</i>

00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:57.674
<i>My job?</i>

00:00:57.754 --> 00:01:01.759
<i>To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,</i>

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:06.716
<i>and use it against you.</i>

00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:14.081
I'm going to flip through this deck.

00:01:14.154 --> 00:01:15.644
And I want you to see one card.

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:17.165
Not this one. That's too obvious.

00:01:17.554 --> 00:01:18.885
Pay close attention.

00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:22.765
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:24.040
Are you ready?

00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:25.115
Okay.

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.963
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:31.037
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:32.963
Now, do you see your card here?

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:34.561
No.

00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:36.841
That's because you're looking too closely.

00:01:36.914 --> 00:01:38.962
And what have I been telling you all night?

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:40.524
The closer you look...

00:01:40.594 --> 00:01:42.164
The less you see.

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:07.800
Now look into my eyes.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.042
And sleep. Okay.

00:02:13.354 --> 00:02:14.560
And...

00:02:15.714 --> 00:02:18.320
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:20.357
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

00:02:20.554 --> 00:02:23.080
If you can say your name, you can have it.

00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:28.635
All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.115
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

00:02:31.194 --> 00:02:32.719
-of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:33.960
I'm picturing...

00:02:34.034 --> 00:02:36.036
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:38.236
Beach. Cocktails.

00:02:38.714 --> 00:02:39.875
Florida?

00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:41.444
Look, it was a business trip.

00:02:41.634 --> 00:02:43.636
I mean, it is a kind of business.

00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:46.604
Maybe the oldest business.

00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:47.920
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.559
She can't move, Mack.

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:51.045
You're thinking of a woman's name.

00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:52.599
A! B! C!

00:02:52.674 --> 00:02:53.914
DI El Fl GI

00:02:53.994 --> 00:02:55.120
H, I, J...

00:02:55.234 --> 00:02:57.043
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

00:02:57.274 --> 00:02:58.355
Who's Janet?

00:02:59.954 --> 00:03:01.194
You know Janet?

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.554
It's not your best friend, is it?

00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:05.564
- Your sister?
- No, please.

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:07.875
Her sister? Oh, my God.

00:03:07.994 --> 00:03:10.042
You weren't away on business.

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:11.843
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

00:03:11.954 --> 00:03:13.240
Your wife's sister!

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.923
Okay, we need to move over here,

00:03:15.994 --> 00:03:18.520
because it seems like
she's a little bit upset right now.

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:20.835
You want this to go away?

00:03:20.914 --> 00:03:22.564
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

00:03:23.114 --> 00:03:24.604
Come on, get it out.

00:03:24.674 --> 00:03:25.960
Do you shake down everybody like this?

00:03:26.074 --> 00:03:27.838
No, only the special few.

00:03:27.914 --> 00:03:29.996
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:32.156
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:33.235
You're a stick-up artist.

00:03:33.314 --> 00:03:34.998
Yeah. Of course.

00:03:35.754 --> 00:03:38.564
Okay, and sleep!

00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:39.999
Now, when I snap my fingers,

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:41.564
you won't remember any of this.

00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:42.840
<i>And you, Warren Beam],</i>

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:45.918
every time you see or even think of Janet,

00:03:46.274 --> 00:03:48.720
you're gonna picture me naked.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:49.920
And that's not a pretty sight.

00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:51.035
Yeah.

00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:53.276
And... You're wide awake!

00:03:56.354 --> 00:03:58.880
Well, we did the best we could,

00:03:58.954 --> 00:04:01.116
but some people
just aren't to be hypnotized.

00:04:01.194 --> 00:04:03.481
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

00:04:03.594 --> 00:04:05.278
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

00:04:05.434 --> 00:04:06.640
Look after her.

00:04:06.714 --> 00:04:08.443
Just have to hit an ATM first.

00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:26.201
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

00:04:26.274 --> 00:04:28.436
and I will give $100

00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:30.835
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

00:04:31.074 --> 00:04:34.556
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

00:04:34.634 --> 00:04:36.079
Check it out.

00:04:36.154 --> 00:04:39.840
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

00:04:40.034 --> 00:04:43.402
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

00:04:53.634 --> 00:04:56.001
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

00:04:56.074 --> 00:04:57.599
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

00:04:57.674 --> 00:05:00.917
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

00:05:00.994 --> 00:05:02.120
I've got other tricks.

00:05:02.194 --> 00:05:04.435
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

00:05:04.514 --> 00:05:05.595
You said you would.

00:05:05.674 --> 00:05:06.914
Nice wallet.

00:05:06.994 --> 00:05:08.234
You have a very good eye, sir.

00:05:08.314 --> 00:05:09.315
Thanks.

00:05:16.474 --> 00:05:17.805
Wallet.

00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:20.196
My wallet. My watch!

00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:25.955
Stop that guy!

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.160
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:28.235
He's got my wallet!

00:05:36.674 --> 00:05:38.039
Okay, Los Angeles,

00:05:38.114 --> 00:05:39.798
are we ready to end this thing?

00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:40.875
Yeah!

00:05:40.954 --> 00:05:43.002
When that timer hits zero,

00:05:43.474 --> 00:05:45.795
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

00:05:45.874 --> 00:05:47.797
will fall from above.

00:05:47.874 --> 00:05:50.605
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

00:05:50.874 --> 00:05:53.559
One, two, three!

00:06:11.194 --> 00:06:12.195
Yeah!

00:06:22.554 --> 00:06:24.238
Help! Stop it!

00:06:26.154 --> 00:06:27.918
She's serious! She can't get out!

00:06:30.034 --> 00:06:31.524
Go get some help!

00:06:32.234 --> 00:06:33.395
Help, dude!

00:06:34.914 --> 00:06:37.235
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:18.282
Come On! This is bullshit!

00:07:18.394 --> 00:07:21.603
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

00:07:26.074 --> 00:07:27.280
Yes!

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:30.644
I am your biggest fan.

00:07:30.754 --> 00:07:32.677
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

00:07:32.754 --> 00:07:33.994
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

00:07:34.074 --> 00:07:35.678
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

00:07:37.754 --> 00:07:39.324
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

00:07:39.394 --> 00:07:40.884
How did you do that...

00:07:40.954 --> 00:07:42.285
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

00:07:42.354 --> 00:07:43.924
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

00:07:46.034 --> 00:07:48.401
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

00:07:48.474 --> 00:07:49.555
How much?

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:50.635
50 bucks.

00:07:50.914 --> 00:07:52.803
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

00:07:52.914 --> 00:07:53.995
Is it always a seven?

00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:55.678
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

00:07:55.754 --> 00:07:57.643
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

00:07:58.074 --> 00:07:59.155
I'll see what I can do.

00:07:59.434 --> 00:08:01.118
Magic man!

00:08:01.474 --> 00:08:02.885
I love your shampoo.

00:08:05.194 --> 00:08:06.434
- Hold up.
- What?

00:08:08.834 --> 00:08:09.881
You need to leave.

00:08:09.954 --> 00:08:10.955
Are you kidding me?

00:08:11.154 --> 00:08:13.156
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

00:08:13.394 --> 00:08:14.395
Is this what you do?

00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:16.442
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

00:08:16.634 --> 00:08:18.762
"45 East Evan Street."

00:08:18.914 --> 00:08:20.325
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

00:08:20.514 --> 00:08:21.925
You don't have my number.

00:08:22.114 --> 00:08:24.162
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

00:08:24.234 --> 00:08:25.759
You are such an asshole.

00:09:38.314 --> 00:09:39.361
Hey!

00:09:40.474 --> 00:09:41.521
Henley.

00:09:41.874 --> 00:09:43.922
<i>Danny'? He'!-</i>

00:09:44.314 --> 00:09:46.794
You got a card, huh?

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.995
No,no,no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

00:09:50.074 --> 00:09:51.075
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

00:09:51.194 --> 00:09:52.480
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

00:09:52.554 --> 00:09:53.760
You wait out here. I will come back

00:09:53.834 --> 00:09:54.915
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:56.758
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

00:09:57.034 --> 00:09:58.365
Nice hair.

00:09:58.434 --> 00:10:00.163
So, actually, what have you been up to?

00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:02.362
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

00:10:02.434 --> 00:10:05.199
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

00:10:05.274 --> 00:10:06.514
You have a website. That's good.

00:10:06.594 --> 00:10:08.358
Good for you. Get the word out.

00:10:10.874 --> 00:10:12.319
Okay.

00:10:12.394 --> 00:10:15.557
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

00:10:15.674 --> 00:10:18.280
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:19.515
Yeah. Excuse me.

00:10:19.594 --> 00:10:21.403
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:24.080
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

00:10:24.194 --> 00:10:25.764
Helen? No, no.

00:10:25.914 --> 00:10:27.279
Henley.

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:28.594
It's on your coffee cup.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.478
Thanks for keeping me honest.

00:10:30.554 --> 00:10:32.079
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

00:10:32.194 --> 00:10:33.275
It was just an observation.

00:10:33.434 --> 00:10:36.961
Second observation, you are beautiful.

00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:38.156
Thank you.

00:10:38.474 --> 00:10:40.954
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

00:10:41.034 --> 00:10:43.321
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

00:10:43.554 --> 00:10:45.204
Very nice. I know
who you are and I just want to say that

00:10:45.314 --> 00:10:46.281
I'm not interested in you doing

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.515
your mentalism thing on us.

00:10:47.754 --> 00:10:50.280
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

00:10:51.034 --> 00:10:55.119
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

00:10:55.194 --> 00:10:56.434
I'm sorry, have we met before?

00:10:56.514 --> 00:10:57.959
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

00:10:58.034 --> 00:10:59.115
You are a control freak.

00:10:59.194 --> 00:11:01.276
Well, I take that as a compliment.

00:11:01.354 --> 00:11:02.765
Only he would take it as a compliment.

00:11:02.834 --> 00:11:04.836
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:08.282
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

00:11:08.354 --> 00:11:09.480
A couple? No, no.

00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:10.760
We were never a couple.

00:11:10.834 --> 00:11:12.643
He used to saw me in half.

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:13.761
She was a very good assistant.

00:11:13.834 --> 00:11:14.881
But I was too fat for Danny.

00:11:14.954 --> 00:11:17.798
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

00:11:17.874 --> 00:11:19.876
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

00:11:19.954 --> 00:11:21.479
No one could fit through there. No one.

00:11:21.554 --> 00:11:22.715
Rebecca fit through.

00:11:22.874 --> 00:11:24.478
Rebecca fit for years.

00:11:24.554 --> 00:11:26.238
Do you know how hard it is to stay

00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:28.197
in those tiny little costumes?

00:11:28.394 --> 00:11:30.237
No. I'm the main attraction.

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:32.482
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

00:11:32.554 --> 00:11:36.479
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

00:11:36.554 --> 00:11:37.999
That's a really nice story.

00:11:38.074 --> 00:11:39.758
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

00:11:39.994 --> 00:11:41.155
No way.

00:11:42.314 --> 00:11:43.918
J. Daniel Atlas?

00:11:44.034 --> 00:11:46.640
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

00:11:46.714 --> 00:11:48.000
You're like...

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.314
I idolize you. Seriously.

00:11:49.394 --> 00:11:50.919
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

00:11:50.994 --> 00:11:52.519
I'm Jack, by the way.

00:11:52.594 --> 00:11:54.005
Question. Did you get one of these?

00:11:55.034 --> 00:11:55.921
Yeah. Death.

00:11:56.794 --> 00:11:57.955
The High Priestess.

00:11:58.114 --> 00:11:59.320
I'm the Lover.

00:11:59.474 --> 00:12:00.521
Three minutes.

00:12:01.514 --> 00:12:02.595
Hermit.

00:12:02.794 --> 00:12:05.445
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

00:12:05.634 --> 00:12:07.079
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

00:12:07.154 --> 00:12:09.680
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

00:12:19.354 --> 00:12:21.163
What is this place?

00:12:25.474 --> 00:12:27.124
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

00:12:34.794 --> 00:12:36.956
Man, it's freezing in here.

00:12:38.634 --> 00:12:39.681
What's that?

00:12:39.874 --> 00:12:41.080
I don't know.

00:12:44.354 --> 00:12:45.355
What's it say?

00:12:46.594 --> 00:12:48.164
"Now you don't."

00:12:48.954 --> 00:12:52.276
"A rose by any other name..."

00:12:57.194 --> 00:12:59.401
Guys, what's happening?

00:13:01.074 --> 00:13:02.599
Look at that.

00:13:09.314 --> 00:13:10.440
It's gag!

00:13:10.674 --> 00:13:12.756
Relax. Just dry ice.

00:13:13.554 --> 00:13:14.555
Cool.

00:13:15.514 --> 00:13:17.004
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

00:13:17.074 --> 00:13:18.838
Hang on. Hang on.

00:13:23.674 --> 00:13:24.835
I got nothin'.

00:13:24.994 --> 00:13:26.758
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

00:13:26.954 --> 00:13:28.956
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

00:13:29.034 --> 00:13:30.604
Okay, so you're like Buddha,

00:13:30.674 --> 00:13:32.119
if he wasn't so enlightened.

00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:33.559
And you're like Jesus,

00:13:33.634 --> 00:13:36.205
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:37.560
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.

00:13:37.634 --> 00:13:39.477
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

00:13:39.554 --> 00:13:40.680
No. Wait, did you?

00:13:40.834 --> 00:13:42.120
I Wish.

00:13:42.594 --> 00:13:44.881
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

00:13:45.874 --> 00:13:47.035
Oh, great.

00:13:52.394 --> 00:13:54.158
Electricity is out.

00:13:55.074 --> 00:13:56.803
Well, let's check.

00:14:13.634 --> 00:14:15.124
Blueprints.

00:14:15.914 --> 00:14:17.325
They're incredible.

00:14:18.754 --> 00:14:20.119
Who do you think did this?

00:14:20.274 --> 00:14:22.436
I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:25.964
It's a show.

00:14:45.794 --> 00:14:47.239
<i>Merritt McKinney,</i>

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.319

00:15:07.634 --> 00:15:09.079
Thank you.

00:15:09.154 --> 00:15:11.316
Tonight we would like to try something

00:15:11.434 --> 00:15:13.960
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

00:15:14.034 --> 00:15:15.559
For our final trick,

00:15:15.634 --> 00:15:17.602
we're gonna do something never before

00:15:17.674 --> 00:15:19.676
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

00:15:20.714 --> 00:15:23.035
Or any stage for that matter.

00:15:23.834 --> 00:15:25.677
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:27.634 --> 00:15:28.715
tonight

00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:31.762
we are going to rob a bank.

00:15:42.354 --> 00:15:44.482
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:48.880
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:56.595
One, two, three!

00:16:05.274 --> 00:16:07.197
Sorry, sir.
There's absolutely no recording allowed

00:16:07.314 --> 00:16:08.554
during the performance.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.636
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

00:16:10.714 --> 00:16:11.795
Let me just put this away.

00:16:11.874 --> 00:16:13.205
Actually, I need to take that.

00:16:13.274 --> 00:16:15.720
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:17.799
Okay.

00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:22.643
Okay, Okay-

00:16:22.874 --> 00:16:24.717
Now, please, please, settle down.

00:16:25.474 --> 00:16:28.318
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

00:16:29.554 --> 00:16:31.556
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

00:16:31.754 --> 00:16:33.438
So we'll choose one at random then.

00:16:35.074 --> 00:16:37.725
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

00:16:38.634 --> 00:16:40.955
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

00:16:41.154 --> 00:16:43.725
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:45.796
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

00:16:45.994 --> 00:16:47.484
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

00:16:47.554 --> 00:16:48.715
Where is Section B?

00:16:49.394 --> 00:16:51.874
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

00:16:52.394 --> 00:16:53.725
I don't know why everybody's happy.

00:16:53.794 --> 00:16:54.841
It's only them.

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:56.718
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

00:16:57.594 --> 00:16:58.675
Thank you, Merritt.

00:16:58.754 --> 00:17:00.563
We are looking at row number 5.

00:17:00.634 --> 00:17:01.760
Where is that?

00:17:01.834 --> 00:17:04.678
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

00:17:05.554 --> 00:17:07.124
Oh. Lucky number 13.

00:17:07.354 --> 00:17:08.879
B-5-13. Where are you?

00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:12.835
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:16.084
Could you just confirm for me that this

00:17:16.154 --> 00:17:18.202
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

00:17:18.274 --> 00:17:19.275
Yes.

00:17:19.354 --> 00:17:21.356
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

00:17:21.434 --> 00:17:22.799
your name and the name of your bank?

00:17:22.994 --> 00:17:25.201
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

00:17:25.474 --> 00:17:28.796
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

00:17:28.994 --> 00:17:30.155
French. Okay.

00:17:30.394 --> 00:17:31.919
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

00:17:31.994 --> 00:17:34.281
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:36.402
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

00:17:36.474 --> 00:17:37.714
Could you please come up to the stage

00:17:37.794 --> 00:17:39.034
and we'll rob your bank.

00:17:39.154 --> 00:17:41.282
And while he does that...

00:17:41.354 --> 00:17:42.640
There is someone here tonight

00:17:42.714 --> 00:17:44.478
without whom we would just be

00:17:44.554 --> 00:17:46.556
four magicians working the circuit,

00:17:46.634 --> 00:17:47.635
trying to get--...

00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:49.245
Well, actually, trying to get here.

00:17:49.474 --> 00:17:50.600
You probably know this man,

00:17:50.674 --> 00:17:52.199
if not from one of the many, many

00:17:52.314 --> 00:17:53.554
companies he puts his name on.

00:17:53.634 --> 00:17:55.762
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

00:17:55.834 --> 00:17:57.165
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

00:17:57.234 --> 00:17:59.316
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

00:17:59.394 --> 00:18:00.395
The only man here with

00:18:00.474 --> 00:18:02.636
the Queen's cell phone number.

00:18:03.154 --> 00:18:05.156
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

00:18:06.154 --> 00:18:08.441
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

00:18:08.514 --> 00:18:10.881
we promised that, as a unit,
we could become

00:18:10.994 --> 00:18:12.075
the biggest name in magic.

00:18:12.154 --> 00:18:13.599
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

00:18:13.674 --> 00:18:15.676
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

00:18:15.754 --> 00:18:17.836
we made sure we put your name on top.

00:18:17.994 --> 00:18:20.076
If you turn out to be as good

00:18:20.194 --> 00:18:22.003
as you think you are, dear girl,

00:18:22.194 --> 00:18:24.276
that won't be necessary much longer.

00:18:24.514 --> 00:18:25.754
We haven't done our closer yet.

00:18:25.834 --> 00:18:27.040
Why don't you watch it

00:18:27.114 --> 00:18:28.445
and then you can decide for yourself.

00:18:28.514 --> 00:18:30.994
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

00:18:31.074 --> 00:18:32.439
Thank you. And, of course, once again,

00:18:32.514 --> 00:18:34.562
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

00:18:34.794 --> 00:18:38.037
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

00:18:38.234 --> 00:18:41.875
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

00:18:42.034 --> 00:18:44.116
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you

00:18:44.354 --> 00:18:48.120
to literally fold through space and time

00:18:48.354 --> 00:18:50.561
to your bank in the...

00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:51.761
8th?

00:18:51.954 --> 00:18:53.877
-9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:55.877
Now, once you are there,

00:18:55.954 --> 00:18:58.036
we will be able to speak
with you through this helmet.

00:18:58.114 --> 00:18:59.878
NOW if...

00:19:00.074 --> 00:19:01.838
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

00:19:01.914 --> 00:19:04.155
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

00:19:04.274 --> 00:19:07.995
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

00:19:09.594 --> 00:19:10.720
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

00:19:10.794 --> 00:19:12.398
- Thank you. Thank you...
-it is.

00:19:13.474 --> 00:19:16.080
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:19:17.434 --> 00:19:18.799
But before you go anywhere,

00:19:18.914 --> 00:19:20.916
could you please, pick a card, any card.

00:19:21.114 --> 00:19:22.240
Not that card.

00:19:22.434 --> 00:19:25.756
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

00:19:25.954 --> 00:19:27.399
Okay. This one?

00:19:27.594 --> 00:19:29.596
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

00:19:31.234 --> 00:19:33.282
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

00:19:33.434 --> 00:19:35.835
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

00:19:36.234 --> 00:19:37.679
- That's good.
- Thanks.

00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:39.920
Put it in your pocket.

00:19:40.274 --> 00:19:42.675
And now for one tiny detail.

00:20:00.114 --> 00:20:04.676
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

00:20:04.874 --> 00:20:07.115
<i>And I'll step off of it. Bonne chance.</i>

00:20:07.194 --> 00:20:09.959
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

00:20:10.154 --> 00:20:12.282
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.

00:20:12.474 --> 00:20:14.841
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

00:20:15.034 --> 00:20:16.035
One,

00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:17.195
two...

00:20:17.274 --> 00:20:18.355
Three.

00:20:21.634 --> 00:20:22.795
What the fuck?

00:20:22.994 --> 00:20:24.644
- Efienne?
- Efienne?

00:20:24.794 --> 00:20:26.762
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

00:20:26.834 --> 00:20:28.120
Efienne?

00:20:28.474 --> 00:20:30.476
I liked that little French guy.

00:20:30.674 --> 00:20:31.721
Where did he go?

00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:42.244
Wait, there he is.

00:20:44.514 --> 00:20:46.562
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

00:20:46.834 --> 00:20:49.485
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

00:20:49.594 --> 00:20:50.834
Etienne? Are you okay?

00:20:50.914 --> 00:20:51.995
<i>Yes.</i>

00:20:52.074 --> 00:20:54.475
Perfect. What do you see in there?

00:20:56.434 --> 00:20:57.515
Money.

00:20:57.994 --> 00:20:59.120
Is this real?

00:20:59.194 --> 00:21:01.720
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

00:21:03.914 --> 00:21:05.518
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

00:21:05.594 --> 00:21:07.562
<i>I want you to take the card that you signed</i>

00:21:07.634 --> 00:21:08.874
<i>out of your pocket.</i>

00:21:09.354 --> 00:21:10.435
And I want you to take the ticket stub

00:21:10.514 --> 00:21:11.561
from tonight's show

00:21:11.754 --> 00:21:12.801
<i>and I want you to put it right there</i>

00:21:12.874 --> 00:21:14.956
<i>in the middle of the money.</i>

00:21:18.034 --> 00:21:19.195
Now drop it.

00:21:31.234 --> 00:21:34.477
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

00:21:34.554 --> 00:21:35.885
Don't press it just yet.

00:21:35.954 --> 00:21:37.718
<i>That button activates an air duct</i>

00:21:37.794 --> 00:21:40.559
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

00:21:40.714 --> 00:21:42.045
<i>Okay, good. Now you can press it.</i>

00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:44.396
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

00:21:44.474 --> 00:21:45.839
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

00:22:16.914 --> 00:22:18.279
Wait a second.

00:23:11.994 --> 00:23:14.281
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

00:23:14.354 --> 00:23:15.515
We are The Four Horsemen.

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:16.720
And good night!

00:23:16.794 --> 00:23:18.398
Good night!

00:23:30.754 --> 00:23:31.960
Hold up here.

00:23:32.314 --> 00:23:33.918
Dylan Rhodes.

00:23:35.394 --> 00:23:37.556
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

00:23:37.634 --> 00:23:39.079
Did you say magicians?

00:23:39.154 --> 00:23:41.077
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

00:23:41.154 --> 00:23:42.360
<i>Where are you now?</i>

00:23:42.474 --> 00:23:44.476
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

00:23:48.674 --> 00:23:50.597
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

00:23:50.674 --> 00:23:52.039
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

00:23:53.434 --> 00:23:55.163
Let's go. Get 'em up.

00:23:55.354 --> 00:23:56.640
Put the book down.

00:23:56.834 --> 00:23:58.598
Okay. You got me.

00:23:58.674 --> 00:24:00.199
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

00:24:00.674 --> 00:24:03.439
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

00:24:03.994 --> 00:24:05.041
Let's go.

00:24:22.874 --> 00:24:24.842
<i>Boss, please tell me this is a joke.</i>

00:24:24.914 --> 00:24:27.963
<i>I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.</i>

00:24:28.034 --> 00:24:29.763
I'm a month, two tops,

00:24:29.834 --> 00:24:31.324
away from blowing this whole thing open.

00:24:31.394 --> 00:24:32.441
Get Turkelson.

00:24:32.514 --> 00:24:33.640
He's in Atlantic City.

00:24:33.714 --> 00:24:34.954
What about Cowan? Look at him.

00:24:35.034 --> 00:24:36.479
He's just sitting there on his ass.

00:24:36.554 --> 00:24:37.760
Hilarious, Rhodes.

00:24:38.234 --> 00:24:39.360
I love you.

00:24:39.674 --> 00:24:40.721
Asshole.

00:24:40.914 --> 00:24:42.484
I don't have time for this magic crap.

00:24:42.554 --> 00:24:45.125
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

00:24:45.194 --> 00:24:46.355
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

00:24:46.434 --> 00:24:47.959
Actually, 3.2.

00:24:51.594 --> 00:24:52.595
Who is she?

00:24:53.594 --> 00:24:54.595
Who are you?

00:24:54.714 --> 00:24:56.364
Alma Dray from Interpol.

00:24:56.514 --> 00:24:58.004
I'll be working the investigation with you.

00:24:58.074 --> 00:24:59.280
You gotta be kidding me.

00:24:59.354 --> 00:25:00.924
It's bad enough they got me chasing down

00:25:01.034 --> 00:25:02.160
David Copperfield and Friends.

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:05.477
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

00:25:05.554 --> 00:25:07.795
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

00:25:07.874 --> 00:25:10.844
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

00:25:10.914 --> 00:25:13.485
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

00:25:13.554 --> 00:25:16.080
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

00:25:16.194 --> 00:25:19.323
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

00:25:19.394 --> 00:25:20.919
Besides, he's useless.

00:25:21.194 --> 00:25:22.798
Oh, really? Why is that?

00:25:22.874 --> 00:25:25.161
Because he believes their magic was real.

00:25:25.234 --> 00:25:26.918
Oh, he believes the magic was real?

00:25:26.994 --> 00:25:28.439
You're right, he probably is useless.

00:25:28.514 --> 00:25:31.882
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

00:25:31.954 --> 00:25:33.524
Thank you.

00:25:34.154 --> 00:25:37.317
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

00:25:37.394 --> 00:25:39.795
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

00:25:39.874 --> 00:25:42.320
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

00:25:42.394 --> 00:25:44.965
- I did.
- Fine. Fantastic. You did.

00:25:45.034 --> 00:25:47.605
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

00:25:47.674 --> 00:25:50.075
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

00:25:50.554 --> 00:25:52.318
With the teleportation helmet.

00:25:52.754 --> 00:25:54.438
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

00:25:54.514 --> 00:25:56.403
He was hypnotized during the show.

00:25:56.474 --> 00:25:58.317
I told you, he's useless.

00:25:58.394 --> 00:25:59.520
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done

00:25:59.594 --> 00:26:01.164
with this other bullshit.

00:26:04.714 --> 00:26:05.681
Hey!

00:26:05.754 --> 00:26:07.438
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

00:26:07.514 --> 00:26:08.800
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

00:26:08.914 --> 00:26:11.201
I guess that "bullshit" was the trigger word.

00:26:11.274 --> 00:26:14.756
Okay. Hey, hey. Ecoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.

00:26:14.834 --> 00:26:16.120
You're not in the Philharmonic.

00:26:16.194 --> 00:26:18.595
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

00:26:18.714 --> 00:26:19.761
Tell him to stop.

00:26:19.834 --> 00:26:24.078
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

00:26:24.394 --> 00:26:26.237
Okay, I need a time-out.

00:26:26.314 --> 00:26:27.839
Too many French people in one room.

00:26:27.954 --> 00:26:29.479
Agent Rhodes!

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:32.239
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

00:26:32.354 --> 00:26:35.403
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

00:26:35.474 --> 00:26:37.044
So we can work together,

00:26:37.234 --> 00:26:39.123
or you can continue to follow behind

00:26:39.234 --> 00:26:41.362
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

00:26:41.474 --> 00:26:42.635
It's up to you.

00:26:46.474 --> 00:26:47.885
I'm not finished.

00:26:47.994 --> 00:26:51.760
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

00:26:51.874 --> 00:26:54.195
And I do not handle jet lag well.

00:26:57.314 --> 00:26:59.715
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

00:26:59.834 --> 00:27:01.916
I promise you, you will lose.

00:27:03.514 --> 00:27:05.642
Fine. So which one of these idiots

00:27:05.714 --> 00:27:07.125
do you want to talk to first?

00:27:07.194 --> 00:27:08.241
Him?

00:27:13.794 --> 00:27:14.920
Dylan, for the record,

00:27:14.994 --> 00:27:17.122
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

00:27:17.194 --> 00:27:18.275
Okay.

00:27:18.354 --> 00:27:19.685
That is to say, that it's not a science.

00:27:19.834 --> 00:27:21.074
It's more for entertainment.

00:27:21.194 --> 00:27:22.434
All right.

00:27:22.514 --> 00:27:25.882
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

00:27:26.834 --> 00:27:29.678
Please convey my deepest apologies

00:27:29.794 --> 00:27:31.558
to your colleague out there.

00:27:31.634 --> 00:27:34.035
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

00:27:34.114 --> 00:27:35.275
I was out of line.

00:27:35.354 --> 00:27:36.594
Tranny Tuesday?

00:27:36.674 --> 00:27:38.358
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

00:27:38.474 --> 00:27:40.203
Or might not have, if you believe

00:27:40.314 --> 00:27:42.760
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

00:27:42.834 --> 00:27:45.440
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI

00:27:45.514 --> 00:27:47.403
of men wearing dresses?

00:27:48.114 --> 00:27:51.835
<i>No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.</i>

00:27:54.914 --> 00:27:56.518
I'm just having fun.

00:27:56.594 --> 00:27:58.915
Was this your card? No.

00:27:58.994 --> 00:28:00.325
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

00:28:00.394 --> 00:28:01.395
and I respect that.

00:28:01.474 --> 00:28:03.363
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

00:28:03.434 --> 00:28:04.481
but I understand protocol.

00:28:04.554 --> 00:28:05.885
Okay, Okay-

00:28:05.954 --> 00:28:08.560
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

00:28:08.634 --> 00:28:11.240
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

00:28:11.314 --> 00:28:12.315
Oh, yes. That would be...

00:28:12.394 --> 00:28:13.919
What do the kids call it these days?

00:28:14.034 --> 00:28:15.160
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

00:28:15.234 --> 00:28:17.236
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

00:28:17.314 --> 00:28:19.920
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:28:20.914 --> 00:28:22.882
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

00:28:23.074 --> 00:28:26.078
It says here you are a mentalist.

00:28:26.714 --> 00:28:29.320
What exactly is mentalism?

00:28:29.394 --> 00:28:32.364
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

00:28:32.594 --> 00:28:36.440
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

00:28:36.594 --> 00:28:39.837
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

00:28:41.514 --> 00:28:43.198
Voices in my head.

00:28:44.434 --> 00:28:47.438
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

00:28:47.514 --> 00:28:49.516
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

00:28:49.594 --> 00:28:52.120
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

00:28:52.194 --> 00:28:54.196
-two TV specials.
- Glory days.

00:28:54.394 --> 00:28:57.876
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

00:28:57.954 --> 00:28:59.285
Did your research, did you?

00:28:59.354 --> 00:29:01.197
IRS audit. Back taxes.

00:29:01.274 --> 00:29:03.038
You've had a long hard slog back

00:29:03.114 --> 00:29:05.515
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

00:29:05.594 --> 00:29:10.282
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

00:29:10.474 --> 00:29:12.442
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

00:29:12.554 --> 00:29:13.715
put on the magical helmet...

00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:14.795
Listen to me.

00:29:14.914 --> 00:29:17.485
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

00:29:17.554 --> 00:29:18.680
Which makes you an accomplice.

00:29:18.754 --> 00:29:21.155
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

00:29:21.274 --> 00:29:22.321
Now you listen to me, unless you think

00:29:22.394 --> 00:29:23.805
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

00:29:23.874 --> 00:29:25.364
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

00:29:25.434 --> 00:29:26.595
then we have a show to perform.

00:29:26.794 --> 00:29:27.841
And you, Agent Rhodes,

00:29:27.914 --> 00:29:29.279
have a drawing board to get back to.

00:29:29.354 --> 00:29:30.799
Is this your first date?

00:29:31.874 --> 00:29:33.035
What?

00:29:33.114 --> 00:29:36.914
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

00:29:36.994 --> 00:29:40.476
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

00:29:40.554 --> 00:29:42.397
And before you get involved,

00:29:42.474 --> 00:29:46.001
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

00:29:46.114 --> 00:29:47.798
And I know the first one is that

00:29:47.874 --> 00:29:51.003
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

00:29:51.394 --> 00:29:52.884
You should have said something to him.

00:29:52.954 --> 00:29:55.116
This is a weird way for you to find out.

00:29:55.194 --> 00:29:57.037
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

00:29:57.154 --> 00:29:59.521
If it means you would
actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

00:29:59.594 --> 00:30:01.039
Because if you did, it means that you,

00:30:01.114 --> 00:30:03.196
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

00:30:03.314 --> 00:30:06.761
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

00:30:07.834 --> 00:30:09.484
The press would have a field day.

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:11.483
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

00:30:11.554 --> 00:30:12.794
And you guys would look like idiots

00:30:12.874 --> 00:30:14.205
even more then you already are.

00:30:14.274 --> 00:30:17.756
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

00:30:17.834 --> 00:30:19.518
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

00:30:19.594 --> 00:30:21.039
"nothing up your sleeve."

00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:22.275
And you know it.

00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:24.436
Don't draw him in and then dump him

00:30:24.594 --> 00:30:27.996
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

00:30:28.514 --> 00:30:29.675
Mommy?

00:30:30.354 --> 00:30:31.594
Daddy.

00:30:31.914 --> 00:30:33.359
You have big daddy issues.

00:30:33.434 --> 00:30:35.004
<i>- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.</i>

00:30:35.074 --> 00:30:38.362
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

00:30:38.474 --> 00:30:40.761
Me? I'll take a tenner.

00:30:41.274 --> 00:30:44.403
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

00:30:44.474 --> 00:30:46.397
I'll still take a tenner.

00:30:46.634 --> 00:30:48.682
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

00:30:48.794 --> 00:30:50.876
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

00:30:51.074 --> 00:30:52.519
And you know who put them there?

00:30:52.594 --> 00:30:54.517
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

00:30:54.594 --> 00:30:58.565
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

00:30:58.634 --> 00:31:01.478
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

00:31:01.554 --> 00:31:03.682
And the instant that you even show

00:31:03.754 --> 00:31:06.439
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

00:31:06.514 --> 00:31:07.845
I'll be there.

00:31:07.914 --> 00:31:09.484
I will be all over you like...

00:31:09.554 --> 00:31:10.760
Like white on rice?

00:31:11.034 --> 00:31:12.524
Sorry. That's unfair.

00:31:12.714 --> 00:31:13.715
Let me warn you.

00:31:13.874 --> 00:31:14.921
I want you to follow.

00:31:15.114 --> 00:31:16.445
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

00:31:16.554 --> 00:31:18.079
we will always be one step, three steps,

00:31:18.154 --> 00:31:19.201
seven steps ahead of you.

00:31:19.274 --> 00:31:20.514
And just when you think you're catching up,

00:31:20.594 --> 00:31:21.959
that's when we'll be right behind you.

00:31:22.034 --> 00:31:23.524
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

00:31:23.594 --> 00:31:24.675
exactly where I want you to be.

00:31:24.754 --> 00:31:26.404
So come close. Get all over me

00:31:26.474 --> 00:31:27.805
because the closer you think you are,

00:31:27.874 --> 00:31:29.285
the less you'll actually see.

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:30.355
I'm gonna nail you...

00:31:34.794 --> 00:31:37.161
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

00:31:45.434 --> 00:31:46.674
Oh! Shit!

00:31:47.274 --> 00:31:48.799
First rule of magic.

00:31:49.594 --> 00:31:51.881
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

00:32:14.954 --> 00:32:16.843
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

00:32:17.074 --> 00:32:19.122
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

00:32:19.194 --> 00:32:21.242
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:23.078
- What changed?
- I met them.

00:32:23.154 --> 00:32:24.155
Hey. Guys.

00:32:24.474 --> 00:32:26.954
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

00:32:27.034 --> 00:32:28.160
Most of it was just filler.

00:32:28.234 --> 00:32:29.918
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

00:32:29.994 --> 00:32:31.803
But guess who was sitting there in the back,

00:32:31.874 --> 00:32:33.035
filming the whole damn thing?

00:32:33.154 --> 00:32:34.155
I don't know.

00:32:34.234 --> 00:32:35.724
Thaddeus Bradley.

00:32:38.234 --> 00:32:40.396
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

00:32:40.514 --> 00:32:41.515
No.

00:32:41.594 --> 00:32:43.915
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

00:32:43.994 --> 00:32:45.837
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

00:32:45.914 --> 00:32:46.995
Get him on the phone.

00:32:47.074 --> 00:32:48.758
I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:49.881
Good.

00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:52.719
<i>Mr. Bradley started as a magician.</i>

00:32:52.794 --> 00:32:54.523
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

00:32:54.834 --> 00:32:56.962
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

00:32:58.314 --> 00:33:01.204
"The greatest genius
is in seeing through the illusion."

00:33:01.274 --> 00:33:03.675
That's a man who loves his work.

00:33:05.154 --> 00:33:06.963
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

00:33:07.034 --> 00:33:09.878
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir.
We're working.

00:33:10.314 --> 00:33:11.475
I will take one.

00:33:20.034 --> 00:33:22.605
That's incredible. That's amazing.

00:33:24.194 --> 00:33:25.355
Red dye, palmed.

00:33:25.474 --> 00:33:28.125
Is that how Jesus did it? That's incredible.

00:33:28.194 --> 00:33:29.559
I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

00:33:29.634 --> 00:33:31.921
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

00:33:32.554 --> 00:33:35.239
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

00:33:35.314 --> 00:33:36.884
in the last half decade?

00:33:36.954 --> 00:33:38.240
About 1.6 million.

00:33:38.314 --> 00:33:41.636
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

00:33:41.714 --> 00:33:43.045
Five million.

00:33:43.114 --> 00:33:44.161
Right, so it's about the money.

00:33:44.234 --> 00:33:45.724
Well, the money is only there

00:33:45.794 --> 00:33:49.082
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

00:33:49.154 --> 00:33:53.443
Like you, I detest those
who prey upon the gullibility of the masses.

00:33:53.514 --> 00:33:57.200
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

00:33:57.754 --> 00:33:58.801
Cost?

00:33:58.874 --> 00:34:00.160
I don't know. Careers.

00:34:00.234 --> 00:34:01.360
Lives.

00:34:01.434 --> 00:34:04.677
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

00:34:05.114 --> 00:34:06.957
I'm sorry, who?

00:34:07.034 --> 00:34:08.559
Lionel Shrike.

00:34:08.634 --> 00:34:13.003
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

00:34:13.074 --> 00:34:16.840
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

00:34:16.914 --> 00:34:20.396
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

00:34:20.474 --> 00:34:21.919
He was shackled inside a safe,

00:34:21.994 --> 00:34:23.803
and dropped into the river.

00:34:23.874 --> 00:34:25.035
But he never resurfaced.

00:34:25.114 --> 00:34:27.355
You mean he died?

00:34:27.434 --> 00:34:29.243
I didn't kill him.

00:34:29.314 --> 00:34:33.558
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

00:34:33.634 --> 00:34:35.875
You do realize this is a game?

00:34:35.954 --> 00:34:37.763
Believe me, it's not a game.

00:34:37.834 --> 00:34:38.995
It is a game.

00:34:39.074 --> 00:34:40.838
You're the game. You're being played.

00:34:40.914 --> 00:34:44.361
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

00:34:44.434 --> 00:34:46.198
I mean, come on.

00:34:46.274 --> 00:34:47.275
You got me.

00:34:47.354 --> 00:34:48.640
If you really want to know

00:34:48.714 --> 00:34:52.514
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

00:34:52.594 --> 00:34:54.562
my special comes out next month.

00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:55.760
Or I could just bring you in

00:34:55.834 --> 00:34:58.314
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

00:34:58.394 --> 00:34:59.919
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:03.123
you actually don't know how they did it.

00:35:05.114 --> 00:35:07.276
Showmanship and theatrics.

00:35:07.474 --> 00:35:09.602
When a magician waves his hand and says,

00:35:09.714 --> 00:35:11.318
"This is where the magic is happening."

00:35:11.554 --> 00:35:14.000
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

00:35:14.474 --> 00:35:17.444
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

00:35:17.634 --> 00:35:19.921
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

00:35:20.114 --> 00:35:21.639
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

00:35:21.794 --> 00:35:24.479
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

00:35:24.754 --> 00:35:25.994
But don't take my word for it.

00:35:26.474 --> 00:35:28.158
How about a trip to Paris?

00:35:28.634 --> 00:35:31.763
Hermia,
the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

00:35:32.274 --> 00:35:33.605
You're joking, right?

00:35:33.794 --> 00:35:36.035
You wanna know how they did it or not?

00:35:36.754 --> 00:35:39.439
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

00:35:40.114 --> 00:35:41.479
Step right up.

00:35:42.754 --> 00:35:44.438
There you go.

00:35:45.114 --> 00:35:48.755
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

00:35:49.794 --> 00:35:52.718
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

00:35:52.794 --> 00:35:54.956
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

00:35:55.034 --> 00:35:57.116
just say the magic word.

00:35:57.434 --> 00:35:58.595
Blow me?

00:35:59.594 --> 00:36:01.358
- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.

00:36:13.394 --> 00:36:16.523
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

00:36:17.154 --> 00:36:19.122
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

00:36:19.314 --> 00:36:21.078
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

00:36:21.474 --> 00:36:22.680
My fun.

00:36:23.994 --> 00:36:25.280
What?

00:36:25.354 --> 00:36:26.719
Nothing.

00:36:28.474 --> 00:36:29.635
So they got a vault set.

00:36:29.714 --> 00:36:30.795
Yes.

00:36:30.874 --> 00:36:32.000
And it's the exact replica

00:36:32.154 --> 00:36:33.235
of the little French guy's bank.

00:36:33.314 --> 00:36:34.361
So he's a plant.

00:36:34.434 --> 00:36:35.924
He was a dupe, not a plant.

00:36:35.994 --> 00:36:38.156
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

00:36:38.594 --> 00:36:40.835
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

00:36:41.634 --> 00:36:44.399
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

00:36:44.474 --> 00:36:46.556
They let them think they picked the seat.

00:36:46.674 --> 00:36:48.039
We'll choose one at random then.

00:36:48.554 --> 00:36:50.397
<i>Actually, they were just palming the ball</i>

00:36:50.514 --> 00:36:52.198
<i>with the seat number they wanted.</i>

00:36:52.674 --> 00:36:54.517
We are looking at row number 5.

00:36:54.674 --> 00:36:56.005
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:57.515
Lucky number 13.

00:36:57.594 --> 00:36:59.642
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

00:36:59.714 --> 00:37:01.318
<i>He was selected.</i>

00:37:02.034 --> 00:37:04.082
<i>They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.</i>

00:37:04.194 --> 00:37:05.355
Viva Las Vegas.

00:37:06.434 --> 00:37:09.483
<i>And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.</i>

00:37:10.674 --> 00:37:11.914
<i>They trailed him.</i>

00:37:12.034 --> 00:37:13.160
<i>They studied him.</i>

00:37:13.234 --> 00:37:14.998
<i>Nothing was left to chance.</i>

00:37:17.274 --> 00:37:18.275
I got his measurements.

00:37:18.354 --> 00:37:20.721
<i>He had no idea he was their target.</i>

00:37:20.874 --> 00:37:23.002
<i>And they simply activated him in Vegas.</i>

00:37:23.154 --> 00:37:24.360
When I snap my fingers...

00:37:24.554 --> 00:37:27.034
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

00:37:27.154 --> 00:37:28.235
<i>But how did they know what bank was his?</i>

00:37:28.594 --> 00:37:29.720
- You're kidding.
- Really?

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:32.440
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

00:37:32.554 --> 00:37:33.555
Yes.

00:37:34.314 --> 00:37:35.315
Like this.

00:37:36.514 --> 00:37:39.802
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

00:37:39.874 --> 00:37:43.401
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

00:37:44.394 --> 00:37:45.395
You ready?

00:37:45.794 --> 00:37:46.795
Yes.

00:37:47.714 --> 00:37:49.125
Credit card.

00:37:49.474 --> 00:37:52.318
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

00:37:52.394 --> 00:37:54.362
they left in the vault in Paris.

00:37:54.434 --> 00:37:55.435
Very good.

00:37:55.674 --> 00:37:57.164
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

00:37:57.434 --> 00:38:00.278
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

00:38:00.394 --> 00:38:01.919
You said they didn't steal the money.

00:38:02.154 --> 00:38:03.644
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

00:38:03.754 --> 00:38:05.199
I said they didn't rob the bank.

00:38:06.354 --> 00:38:08.322
<i>My guess is that they targeted</i>

00:38:08.394 --> 00:38:10.078
<i>a shipment of freshly minted money</i>

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:14.079
<i>headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.</i>

00:38:15.514 --> 00:38:18.279
<i>Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.</i>

00:38:18.434 --> 00:38:21.040
<i>Unless you're already inside.</i>

00:38:40.594 --> 00:38:43.643
<i>And despite what the banks
would have you believe,</i>

00:38:43.714 --> 00:38:46.558
<i>the men who drive
these trucks are not exactly mental giants.</i>

00:38:48.274 --> 00:38:49.844
<i>For our Horsemen,</i>

00:38:49.914 --> 00:38:52.155
<i>it was almost too easy.</i>

00:38:58.474 --> 00:38:59.635
Hey, boys.

00:39:05.994 --> 00:39:09.601
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

00:39:09.994 --> 00:39:11.439
<i>Flash paper.</i>

00:39:13.674 --> 00:39:15.881
<i>Magicians use it all the time.</i>

00:39:21.074 --> 00:39:23.884
<i>Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.</i>

00:39:29.234 --> 00:39:31.601
<i>Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,</i>

00:39:31.794 --> 00:39:34.365
<i>but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.</i>

00:39:34.434 --> 00:39:36.914
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

00:39:36.994 --> 00:39:39.759
Give your audience $3 million.

00:39:39.954 --> 00:39:41.319
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

00:39:41.434 --> 00:39:42.640
Best finale ever.

00:39:42.714 --> 00:39:45.160
<i>They're gonna be
the first magicians in history to get laid.</i>

00:39:45.234 --> 00:39:47.714
<i>Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,</i>

00:39:47.794 --> 00:39:49.842
put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

00:39:49.914 --> 00:39:52.281
<i>I always do. It's lawyer first,</i>

00:39:52.354 --> 00:39:54.402
<i>-then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.</i>

00:39:54.474 --> 00:39:55.885
Yes. Then the children.

00:39:56.754 --> 00:39:59.439
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

00:39:59.514 --> 00:40:00.675
And what's that?

00:40:00.754 --> 00:40:03.883
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

00:40:03.954 --> 00:40:06.116
Unrequited and misguided,

00:40:06.194 --> 00:40:09.004
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

00:40:09.074 --> 00:40:11.759
Consequently, you're very tightly...

00:40:11.834 --> 00:40:13.438
How should I put it?

00:40:13.954 --> 00:40:14.955
Corked.

00:40:15.034 --> 00:40:16.035
Oh, lam?

00:40:16.114 --> 00:40:19.755
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:22.485
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

00:40:22.554 --> 00:40:27.242
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

00:40:27.474 --> 00:40:28.600
Wow. Thanks.

00:40:28.674 --> 00:40:31.439
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

00:40:31.514 --> 00:40:35.439
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

00:40:39.074 --> 00:40:41.076
<i>We should be getting there
a few minutes early.</i>

00:40:41.154 --> 00:40:42.235
<i>So, sit back, relax.</i>

00:40:42.314 --> 00:40:44.078
<i>We should be in the Big Easy soon.</i>

00:40:44.154 --> 00:40:45.883
<i>Appreciate you flying with us today.</i>

00:40:45.954 --> 00:40:48.400
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

00:40:48.474 --> 00:40:49.555
Ego.

00:40:51.234 --> 00:40:52.998
Okay, pick your card.

00:40:53.474 --> 00:40:55.954
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

00:40:56.034 --> 00:40:57.877
No, don't tell me.

00:40:57.954 --> 00:40:59.763
-Okay-
-Okay-

00:40:59.834 --> 00:41:01.245
Thaddeus was there that night.

00:41:01.314 --> 00:41:03.760
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

00:41:03.834 --> 00:41:05.518
What are you saying?

00:41:05.594 --> 00:41:07.084
You think they could be working together.

00:41:07.154 --> 00:41:08.599
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

00:41:08.674 --> 00:41:10.119
were a bunch of street magicians

00:41:10.194 --> 00:41:11.764
a year ago with no resources.

00:41:11.834 --> 00:41:14.405
So, how do they go from doing that to this

00:41:14.474 --> 00:41:15.919
without some kind of outside help?

00:41:15.994 --> 00:41:17.439
Is this your card?

00:41:17.514 --> 00:41:20.916
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

00:41:21.554 --> 00:41:23.283
Nice shuffle.

00:41:23.354 --> 00:41:24.515
You know, this is hard.

00:41:24.594 --> 00:41:25.641
According to this book,

00:41:25.714 --> 00:41:29.764
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

00:41:29.874 --> 00:41:32.923
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

00:41:32.994 --> 00:41:35.235
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

00:41:35.314 --> 00:41:37.555
Or specifically those guys?

00:41:38.314 --> 00:41:40.920
I could care less about magicians in general.

00:41:40.994 --> 00:41:43.838
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

00:41:43.914 --> 00:41:45.040
Exploit them how?

00:41:45.114 --> 00:41:46.479
Try again.

00:41:47.594 --> 00:41:49.517
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

00:41:49.594 --> 00:41:52.359
Their need
to believe in something that's unexplainable

00:41:52.434 --> 00:41:55.324
in order to make their lives more bearable.

00:41:55.514 --> 00:41:57.198
I see it as a strength.

00:41:57.274 --> 00:41:59.242
My life is happier when I believe that.

00:42:00.274 --> 00:42:01.639
Is this your card?

00:42:02.794 --> 00:42:03.920
Yeah.

00:42:04.754 --> 00:42:05.835
Yeah?

00:42:05.954 --> 00:42:07.479
- Yeah.
- Cool.

00:42:09.874 --> 00:42:13.242
That smile on your face. Is it real?

00:42:13.314 --> 00:42:14.554
Maybe.

00:42:15.034 --> 00:42:17.435
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

00:42:17.514 --> 00:42:18.959
Do you feel exploited?

00:42:19.034 --> 00:42:22.277
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

00:42:24.554 --> 00:42:25.794
Guy goes to the doctor.

00:42:25.874 --> 00:42:26.921
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna

00:42:26.994 --> 00:42:28.075
"have to stop masturbating."

00:42:28.154 --> 00:42:29.155
He says, "Why?"

00:42:29.234 --> 00:42:30.724
He says, "So I can finish the examination."

00:42:30.794 --> 00:42:31.875
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

00:42:31.954 --> 00:42:33.524
-my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

00:42:33.594 --> 00:42:34.834
Hey, guys.

00:42:35.314 --> 00:42:36.725
We got a show to prepare for.

00:42:36.794 --> 00:42:39.161
Do we now?

00:42:39.234 --> 00:42:40.281
No, no, no, don't do that.

00:42:40.354 --> 00:42:41.515
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

00:42:41.634 --> 00:42:42.920
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

00:42:42.994 --> 00:42:44.598
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

00:42:44.674 --> 00:42:46.085
I know all of your little tricks.

00:42:46.154 --> 00:42:47.315
That what they are to you? Tricks?

00:42:47.394 --> 00:42:49.123
Yes, it's gimmicks. it's Barnum statements.

00:42:49.194 --> 00:42:50.923
It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

00:42:50.994 --> 00:42:52.644
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

00:42:52.714 --> 00:42:54.478
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

00:42:54.554 --> 00:42:56.761
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

00:42:56.834 --> 00:42:58.324
No.

00:42:58.634 --> 00:42:59.681
Do me.

00:42:59.754 --> 00:43:01.165
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

00:43:01.234 --> 00:43:02.235
Okay.

00:43:02.354 --> 00:43:03.401
Even better.

00:43:03.474 --> 00:43:04.475
- Art.
- Yeah.

00:43:04.594 --> 00:43:06.358
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,

00:43:06.434 --> 00:43:07.481
when I want to be.

00:43:07.554 --> 00:43:09.761
Just stay with me, okay?

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:12.277
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

00:43:12.394 --> 00:43:14.442
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

00:43:14.514 --> 00:43:16.437
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

00:43:16.514 --> 00:43:18.437
A brutish breed. Like a real...

00:43:18.514 --> 00:43:20.676
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

00:43:20.754 --> 00:43:23.200
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

00:43:23.274 --> 00:43:26.357
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

00:43:27.874 --> 00:43:29.205
Sorry.

00:43:29.354 --> 00:43:30.480
Wait, let me try one.

00:43:30.554 --> 00:43:31.635
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

00:43:31.714 --> 00:43:32.795
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

00:43:32.914 --> 00:43:34.484
He can do way better than that.

00:43:34.554 --> 00:43:35.555
Let's do family.

00:43:35.674 --> 00:43:38.883
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

00:43:39.034 --> 00:43:41.605
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

00:43:41.714 --> 00:43:43.955
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

00:43:44.034 --> 00:43:45.559
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

00:43:45.634 --> 00:43:49.798
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

00:43:49.954 --> 00:43:51.558
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

00:43:51.634 --> 00:43:53.124
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

00:43:53.194 --> 00:43:56.641
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

00:43:56.794 --> 00:43:58.364
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

00:43:58.434 --> 00:43:59.481
That was your childhood?

00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:01.921
I certainly hope
tonight's show is gonna be better than this.

00:44:02.794 --> 00:44:04.922
Don't worry. Just you wait.

00:44:10.234 --> 00:44:13.317
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

00:44:13.394 --> 00:44:14.520
<i>What, are you kidding me?</i>

00:44:14.594 --> 00:44:16.164
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

00:44:16.234 --> 00:44:18.157
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

00:44:18.234 --> 00:44:20.601
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

00:44:22.474 --> 00:44:24.442
Hey, hey! There you are.

00:44:24.754 --> 00:44:26.119
What, the French girl
doing a little sightseeing

00:44:26.234 --> 00:44:27.235
while she's in New Orleans?

00:44:27.314 --> 00:44:29.555
No. In fact, here, speaking French

00:44:29.634 --> 00:44:31.318
is actually an asset.

00:44:31.394 --> 00:44:32.919
Do you see that woman up there?

00:44:33.954 --> 00:44:35.080
That's Marie Claire.

00:44:35.154 --> 00:44:37.441
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

00:44:39.754 --> 00:44:41.085
You're welcome.

00:44:41.434 --> 00:44:42.720
Yeah.

00:44:42.794 --> 00:44:44.444
We got a place.

00:44:46.394 --> 00:44:49.603
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

00:44:49.674 --> 00:44:51.085
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

00:44:51.154 --> 00:44:54.237
- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

00:44:54.314 --> 00:44:58.160
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

00:44:58.234 --> 00:45:02.125
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

00:45:03.954 --> 00:45:05.797
This other guy, Maximillian...

00:45:05.994 --> 00:45:08.964
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

00:45:09.394 --> 00:45:11.874
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

00:45:11.954 --> 00:45:13.877
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

00:45:13.954 --> 00:45:16.161
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

00:45:16.234 --> 00:45:19.044
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

00:45:19.114 --> 00:45:21.321
This what? This magic?

00:45:22.754 --> 00:45:24.085
Lionel Shrike.

00:45:24.314 --> 00:45:27.841
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

00:45:27.914 --> 00:45:30.918
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

00:45:31.114 --> 00:45:32.525
They saw the tree in half.

00:45:32.594 --> 00:45:34.676
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

00:45:34.754 --> 00:45:36.597
is the card with the signature.

00:45:36.674 --> 00:45:37.800
HOW did he do that?

00:45:37.914 --> 00:45:41.236
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

00:45:44.474 --> 00:45:45.919
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

00:45:45.994 --> 00:45:47.564
<i>No, but I do have some good news.</i>

00:45:47.794 --> 00:45:49.762
Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

00:45:49.834 --> 00:45:51.598
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

00:45:51.674 --> 00:45:52.960
What tracking bracelets?

00:45:53.034 --> 00:45:54.274
<i>He has every member of his crew</i>

00:45:54.354 --> 00:45:55.958
<i>wearing a tracking bracelet.</i>

00:45:56.034 --> 00:45:58.116
<i>Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.</i>

00:45:58.194 --> 00:45:59.400
<i>So as long as Atlas is tracking them...</i>

00:45:59.474 --> 00:46:00.555
Next.

00:46:00.634 --> 00:46:01.715
...our boys can track Atlas

00:46:01.794 --> 00:46:03.205
from right here in the mobile command unit.

00:46:03.314 --> 00:46:05.282
<i>Okay, call me if you get any movement.</i>

00:46:05.354 --> 00:46:06.685
Copy that.

00:46:15.474 --> 00:46:17.841
You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

00:46:19.194 --> 00:46:22.835
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

00:46:22.994 --> 00:46:26.840
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

00:46:27.234 --> 00:46:28.884
And I watch the people make a wish

00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:31.076
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

00:46:31.154 --> 00:46:33.839
Then throw the key into the Seine.

00:46:35.674 --> 00:46:40.236
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

00:46:40.514 --> 00:46:42.482
Watching the key sink into the water

00:46:42.554 --> 00:46:45.797
and their secret is locked away forever.

00:46:46.674 --> 00:46:50.998
Real and, at the same time, magical.

00:46:57.234 --> 00:46:58.360
So,

00:46:59.194 --> 00:47:02.880
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:05.594
Yeah.

00:47:12.034 --> 00:47:13.957
<i>There is a legend of a secret order</i>

00:47:14.034 --> 00:47:15.923
<i>born in ancient Egypt called</i>

00:47:16.354 --> 00:47:17.685
<i>"The Eye."</i>

00:47:19.354 --> 00:47:21.834
<i>It is said they perfected sleight of hand</i>

00:47:21.914 --> 00:47:23.996
<i>to steal food from the Pharaohs</i>

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:25.883
<i>and give it to the slaves.</i>

00:47:26.274 --> 00:47:27.480
<i>Their purpose?</i>

00:47:27.554 --> 00:47:31.559
<i>Using magic
and illusion to even the scales of justice.</i>

00:47:32.434 --> 00:47:36.758
<i>Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?</i>

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:41.921
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

00:47:42.714 --> 00:47:47.003
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

00:47:47.554 --> 00:47:49.158
get the better of them?

00:47:55.594 --> 00:47:57.084
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

00:47:57.234 --> 00:47:59.236
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

00:47:59.314 --> 00:48:01.635
which you don't, or you should leave.

00:48:01.834 --> 00:48:05.600
If I want something to cease or desist,

00:48:06.754 --> 00:48:07.915
it does.

00:48:08.114 --> 00:48:09.320
Take five.

00:48:09.634 --> 00:48:11.443
According to your potential backers,

00:48:11.634 --> 00:48:15.275
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:16.959
from your best special.

00:48:17.194 --> 00:48:19.845
I have here a check

00:48:21.594 --> 00:48:22.834
for 3.5 million.

00:48:23.114 --> 00:48:24.115
To walk away?

00:48:24.274 --> 00:48:27.960
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

00:48:30.114 --> 00:48:32.799
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

00:48:34.354 --> 00:48:36.436
You're in this to ride them up.

00:48:36.954 --> 00:48:38.956
I'm in it to ride them down.

00:48:39.274 --> 00:48:42.278
I take it that we do not have a deal.

00:48:43.794 --> 00:48:48.118
And therein lies our conflict.

00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:52.794
Let me be blunt.

00:48:53.234 --> 00:48:57.683
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

00:48:57.874 --> 00:49:00.718
And my lawyers are much stronger.

00:49:01.074 --> 00:49:04.157
And they will manacle you

00:49:05.394 --> 00:49:07.237
with so many injunctions.

00:49:07.474 --> 00:49:09.715
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

00:49:09.834 --> 00:49:12.485
everything that you own drain away

00:49:13.314 --> 00:49:15.840
in front of your greedy little eyes.

00:49:15.954 --> 00:49:18.161
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

00:49:19.554 --> 00:49:21.044
And I'm still here.

00:49:21.114 --> 00:49:25.483
It is, however,
the first time you've been threatened by me.

00:49:26.314 --> 00:49:30.763
And if you do anything
to sully my investment,

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:33.235
the ride down, which you mentioned,

00:49:33.314 --> 00:49:38.559
will be sudden, precipitous,
and measurable on the Richter scale.

00:49:40.194 --> 00:49:42.196
You shouldn't have done that.

00:49:43.514 --> 00:49:45.118
According to superstition,

00:49:45.314 --> 00:49:48.318
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

00:49:48.394 --> 00:49:52.877
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

00:49:53.674 --> 00:49:55.199
Isn't that funny?

00:49:56.034 --> 00:49:58.036
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

00:50:07.954 --> 00:50:09.035
Do me a favor.

00:50:09.114 --> 00:50:13.164
Visualize your most adventurous
sexual experience.

00:50:13.274 --> 00:50:14.321
Stay out of my head, you perv.

00:50:14.394 --> 00:50:18.080
Well, no, if I stay out of your head,
I'm never gonna get into your pants.

00:50:18.194 --> 00:50:20.196
- Right.
- So let's stick with this exercise.

00:50:20.274 --> 00:50:22.163
- And it helps...
- Pardon the intrusion.

00:50:22.234 --> 00:50:24.805
I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight.

00:50:24.874 --> 00:50:27.480
What, so you can try to expose us later
on your little website?

00:50:27.554 --> 00:50:28.760
And on demand.

00:50:28.834 --> 00:50:31.838
- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, no?

00:50:31.914 --> 00:50:34.918
Operating on a special plane
because of The Eye?

00:50:35.594 --> 00:50:40.441
I heard it's a lovely place.
Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

00:50:40.514 --> 00:50:42.994
Make any magician's wish come true.

00:50:43.074 --> 00:50:44.519
You've come a long way,

00:50:44.594 --> 00:50:46.403
much further
than anyone would have expected

00:50:46.514 --> 00:50:48.516
of a bunch of wanna-bes and has-beens.

00:50:48.594 --> 00:50:52.758
If by "has-been" you're referring to me,
I just wanna say I'm flattered,

00:50:52.834 --> 00:50:56.236
because I always considered myself
a never-was.

00:50:56.314 --> 00:50:58.476
Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

00:50:59.274 --> 00:51:00.275
By all means.

00:51:01.274 --> 00:51:05.916
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

00:51:06.034 --> 00:51:08.958
He wants to be a great magician someday.

00:51:09.034 --> 00:51:10.798
And though he's good,
he's not quite good enough.

00:51:10.914 --> 00:51:14.999
So he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain,

00:51:15.074 --> 00:51:18.635
feeding off of those
who have the talent that he never did.

00:51:18.754 --> 00:51:21.280
Tell me. Am I getting close?

00:51:23.954 --> 00:51:26.958
Wait. Before you go. I'm working
on something new. Do you have a second?

00:51:27.634 --> 00:51:30.478
Okay. Name a card.

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:32.124
- King of hearts.
- Knew it.

00:51:32.194 --> 00:51:33.434
Okay.

00:51:40.634 --> 00:51:43.717
- It's up your left sleeve.
- Is it?

00:51:43.794 --> 00:51:45.558
No. No, I don't see it up there.

00:51:45.634 --> 00:51:49.355
You know, why don't you check
your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

00:51:51.194 --> 00:51:52.195
Yeah.

00:51:55.634 --> 00:52:00.640
Anyway, thank you so much for coming by,
but this is kind of a talent only area, so...

00:52:01.914 --> 00:52:02.915
Break a leg.

00:52:02.994 --> 00:52:05.156
Hey, you break something, too.

00:52:05.234 --> 00:52:06.565
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:52:06.634 --> 00:52:08.318

Nice watch.

00:52:31.634 --> 00:52:34.001
It's a family heirloom.

00:52:37.194 --> 00:52:39.925
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

00:52:39.994 --> 00:52:41.564
- Who?
- Shrike.

00:52:41.634 --> 00:52:43.921
So, when he was 14,

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:46.156
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

00:52:46.234 --> 00:52:49.920
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

00:52:49.994 --> 00:52:52.645
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

00:52:52.714 --> 00:52:53.875
And?

00:52:53.954 --> 00:52:58.118
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

00:52:58.194 --> 00:53:01.482
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

00:53:01.554 --> 00:53:03.124
and presto!

00:53:03.234 --> 00:53:04.963
The card is in the tree.

00:53:05.034 --> 00:53:06.923
It was in the tree for 18 years.

00:53:06.994 --> 00:53:08.484
The card was in the tree.

00:53:08.554 --> 00:53:12.559
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

00:53:12.634 --> 00:53:15.558
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

00:53:15.634 --> 00:53:17.636
It was to look so far

00:53:17.714 --> 00:53:20.524
that you see 20 years into the past.

00:53:20.594 --> 00:53:23.484
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

00:53:23.554 --> 00:53:25.363
What are you suggesting?

Thank you. Before we begin,

00:53:45.674 --> 00:53:47.722
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

00:53:47.794 --> 00:53:50.274
A man and a woman to whom
we'd like to dedicate tonight's performance.

00:53:50.354 --> 00:53:52.197
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

00:53:52.274 --> 00:53:57.997
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

00:53:58.914 --> 00:54:03.044
Yeah, Agent Rhodes has personally vowed
to "nail us."

00:54:03.114 --> 00:54:07.597
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

00:54:11.874 --> 00:54:14.036
What is magic?

00:54:14.114 --> 00:54:16.640
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

00:54:18.314 --> 00:54:19.725
So I want you to look.

00:54:20.274 --> 00:54:22.356
Look as closely as possible.

00:54:22.754 --> 00:54:24.483
Because the tricks you are about to see

00:54:24.994 --> 00:54:26.723
may not seem connected.

00:54:26.794 --> 00:54:28.717
But we assure you, they are.

00:54:29.674 --> 00:54:32.484
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

00:54:32.794 --> 00:54:36.480
Or is it one giant illusion?

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:47.118
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

00:54:47.234 --> 00:54:49.362
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

00:54:49.434 --> 00:54:51.721
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

00:54:51.914 --> 00:54:55.919
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

00:54:56.114 --> 00:54:58.355
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

00:54:58.474 --> 00:55:01.284
and put her inside this mystery box.

00:55:01.714 --> 00:55:03.443
There are two pencils out there.

00:55:03.514 --> 00:55:04.754
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:06.324
- Here!
- Yeah!

00:55:06.754 --> 00:55:08.722
And now, you will say the magic word.

00:55:08.794 --> 00:55:10.034
Abracadabra.

00:55:10.154 --> 00:55:11.519
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

00:55:11.594 --> 00:55:13.198
for no reason. And then...

00:55:13.274 --> 00:55:15.675
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

00:55:17.034 --> 00:55:19.275
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

00:55:19.354 --> 00:55:20.515
you're about to.

00:55:20.754 --> 00:55:21.880
And sleep.

00:55:21.954 --> 00:55:24.798
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

00:55:24.874 --> 00:55:26.444
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

00:55:26.514 --> 00:55:28.562
And now we are gonna debunk

00:55:28.634 --> 00:55:30.796
a few magic myths this evening.

00:55:30.874 --> 00:55:34.037
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

00:55:34.314 --> 00:55:36.885
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

00:55:36.954 --> 00:55:38.479
As has the mirror

00:55:38.554 --> 00:55:40.955
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

00:55:41.034 --> 00:55:43.116
When you hear the word "freeze"

00:55:43.354 --> 00:55:45.561
you are all football players.

00:55:46.034 --> 00:55:48.560
And your job is to tackle,

00:55:48.714 --> 00:55:50.045
dismantle,

00:55:50.234 --> 00:55:51.395
crush,

00:55:51.634 --> 00:55:53.955
tear limb from limb,

00:55:54.354 --> 00:55:56.083
the quarterback.

00:55:57.434 --> 00:56:00.961
Now, we've all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

00:56:01.034 --> 00:56:04.038
But has anyone heard
of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

00:56:08.434 --> 00:56:10.914
You will know who the quarterback is.

00:56:10.994 --> 00:56:14.316
He will be the one saying that word.

00:56:14.394 --> 00:56:15.600
Freeze.

00:56:26.394 --> 00:56:28.396
Three, two, one...

00:56:35.754 --> 00:56:37.722
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:39.239
Kill the quarterback!

00:56:39.314 --> 00:56:40.918
Get on back to your seats.

00:56:41.154 --> 00:56:43.282
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

00:57:15.714 --> 00:57:17.364
I guess you have lost some weight.

00:57:32.914 --> 00:57:34.075
At the intermission,

00:57:34.274 --> 00:57:36.641
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

00:57:36.834 --> 00:57:38.199
and seal it in an envelope.

00:57:38.274 --> 00:57:39.924
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

00:57:39.994 --> 00:57:41.120
Everyone take 'em out.

00:57:42.554 --> 00:57:44.044
Now, everybody,

00:57:44.114 --> 00:57:47.084
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

00:57:48.794 --> 00:57:50.364
Shout 'em out.

00:57:52.434 --> 00:57:54.357
Clement? Frannick?

00:57:54.554 --> 00:57:56.602
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

00:57:56.674 --> 00:57:58.642
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

00:57:58.834 --> 00:58:00.245
That's me!

00:58:00.314 --> 00:58:02.635
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

00:58:04.034 --> 00:58:06.002
Josepha Hickey?

00:58:06.074 --> 00:58:07.075
That's me!

00:58:07.154 --> 00:58:10.078
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

00:58:10.194 --> 00:58:12.162
and count from one to 10 out loud.

00:58:12.354 --> 00:58:14.004
One, two, three, four, five...

00:58:14.074 --> 00:58:15.314
Stop.

00:58:15.594 --> 00:58:17.358
Is the first digit 5?

00:58:17.434 --> 00:58:18.401
Yes.

00:58:18.474 --> 00:58:19.839
Do it again. This time, faster.

00:58:19.914 --> 00:58:21.325
One, two, three, four, five, six...

00:58:21.394 --> 00:58:22.475
Stop.

00:58:23.194 --> 00:58:24.719
Six. Again.

00:58:24.794 --> 00:58:25.795
One, two...

00:58:25.994 --> 00:58:29.965
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

00:58:30.154 --> 00:58:32.361
Yeah. That's what I got.

00:58:34.074 --> 00:58:35.644
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

00:58:35.794 --> 00:58:36.841
Okay, Dina,

00:58:38.754 --> 00:58:39.801
1 ,

00:58:40.394 --> 00:58:41.441
<i>4.</i>

00:58:42.154 --> 00:58:43.155
<i>7,</i>

00:58:44.114 --> 00:58:45.718
-7.
- Yeah.

00:58:45.794 --> 00:58:49.560
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

00:58:49.634 --> 00:58:50.795
Clement.

00:58:50.914 --> 00:58:53.884
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

00:58:54.074 --> 00:58:57.874
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

00:58:59.874 --> 00:59:02.684
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

00:59:04.154 --> 00:59:05.644
Focus on your number.

00:59:09.874 --> 00:59:12.957
This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

00:59:13.074 --> 00:59:15.281
Oh, this is strange.

00:59:15.674 --> 00:59:18.837
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

00:59:19.034 --> 00:59:20.877
Every last one of you is dead wrong

00:59:20.954 --> 00:59:23.116
about what you think is in your account.

00:59:23.194 --> 00:59:24.605
Okay, you can sit down now.

00:59:25.234 --> 00:59:27.521
Yeah. I almost forgot.

00:59:27.634 --> 00:59:30.524
This evening would not be possible

00:59:30.594 --> 00:59:34.121
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

00:59:35.634 --> 00:59:37.284
Big applause! Big applause!

00:59:37.474 --> 00:59:38.839
Art, actually, why don't
you come up on stage

00:59:38.914 --> 00:59:40.075
for the finale?

00:59:40.154 --> 00:59:41.963
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

00:59:42.034 --> 00:59:43.957
There he goes. Okay, good.

00:59:44.034 --> 00:59:45.081
Are we on red?

00:59:45.154 --> 00:59:47.202
Bright red. We're all standing by.

00:59:47.274 --> 00:59:48.764
All right, no one leaves the theater. No one.

00:59:48.834 --> 00:59:49.995
There he goes.

00:59:50.634 --> 00:59:52.841
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

00:59:52.914 --> 00:59:54.757
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

00:59:55.434 --> 00:59:58.244
Now, Art, I took a guess.

00:59:58.314 --> 01:00:00.521
North of 140. Am I right?

01:00:01.634 --> 01:00:04.319
That's 140 million, by the way.

01:00:07.914 --> 01:00:08.915
I'm sorry, Merritt.

01:00:09.114 --> 01:00:11.037
How can he be right about his balance

01:00:11.114 --> 01:00:12.275
and everyone else be wrong?

01:00:12.394 --> 01:00:15.762
I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

01:00:15.954 --> 01:00:18.082
Everybody, take out your paper.

01:00:18.234 --> 01:00:20.805
And using the flashlight under your seat,

01:00:20.954 --> 01:00:22.797
start to warm up that paper.

01:00:22.954 --> 01:00:26.117
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

01:00:29.754 --> 01:00:32.963
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

01:00:33.274 --> 01:00:34.321
Yes.

01:00:41.074 --> 01:00:42.485
Look.

01:00:43.314 --> 01:00:44.645
What's going on there, Daniel?

01:00:44.714 --> 01:00:46.239
Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said

01:00:46.474 --> 01:00:50.240
$144,579,651.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.315
But now...

01:00:51.834 --> 01:00:54.838
Now it says $70,000 less.

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.599
Josepha, can you stand up?

01:00:59.674 --> 01:01:00.755
Yes.

01:01:00.994 --> 01:01:02.644
Now, what is your new number?

01:01:02.954 --> 01:01:07.278
$70,562 now in my account.

01:01:10.394 --> 01:01:13.796
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

01:01:13.914 --> 01:01:15.996
the exact amount that Art's went down?

01:01:16.114 --> 01:01:18.640
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

01:01:19.034 --> 01:01:20.081
Is it?

01:01:21.514 --> 01:01:23.835
Wow. It is.

01:01:24.194 --> 01:01:27.357
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

01:01:27.514 --> 01:01:29.562
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

01:01:29.794 --> 01:01:33.560
$281,477.

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:39.078
We have a confession to make.

01:01:39.274 --> 01:01:41.276
She's right. We lied about something.

01:01:41.354 --> 01:01:43.038
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

01:01:43.154 --> 01:01:45.555
All of you have one thing in common.

01:01:46.114 --> 01:01:48.003
Everyone in this room was a victim

01:01:48.074 --> 01:01:50.964
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

01:01:51.034 --> 01:01:53.640
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

01:01:54.074 --> 01:01:55.075
Your businesses.

01:01:55.234 --> 01:01:56.235
Your loved ones.

01:01:56.354 --> 01:01:59.563
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

01:01:59.714 --> 01:02:01.603
Tressler Insurance.

01:02:02.714 --> 01:02:03.875
You were abandoned.

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:05.035
You were loopholed...

01:02:05.114 --> 01:02:06.354
...out of your settlements.

01:02:07.714 --> 01:02:10.365
This is all for show. Correct?

01:02:10.434 --> 01:02:12.960
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

01:02:13.274 --> 01:02:14.878
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

01:02:15.194 --> 01:02:17.674
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.677
It says it right here on my cell phone!

01:02:19.954 --> 01:02:23.083
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

01:02:30.874 --> 01:02:31.875
Is this for real?

01:02:32.074 --> 01:02:33.235
I don't know.

01:02:33.554 --> 01:02:34.635
<i>Is this happening?</i>

01:02:34.794 --> 01:02:36.364
I don't know! I can't tell!

01:02:37.114 --> 01:02:39.242
Hey! Did you do this?

01:02:40.474 --> 01:02:41.680
How could we, Art?

01:02:41.754 --> 01:02:42.915
We don't have your password.

01:02:43.234 --> 01:02:44.565
We'd need access to information

01:02:44.634 --> 01:02:46.557
we could never get our hands on.

01:02:46.754 --> 01:02:48.722
Yes, security questions, for instance, like,

01:02:48.914 --> 01:02:50.484
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

01:02:50.594 --> 01:02:52.084
or the name of your first pet.

01:02:52.154 --> 01:02:53.918
Where would we get that information, Art?

01:02:54.434 --> 01:02:56.084
You certainly would never tell us.

01:02:58.834 --> 01:03:00.962
<i>We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.</i>

01:03:03.274 --> 01:03:04.719
Do not let them get away.

01:03:04.834 --> 01:03:06.836
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

01:03:13.794 --> 01:03:15.125
You got hell to pay!

01:03:18.114 --> 01:03:19.115
Stop!

01:03:19.834 --> 01:03:21.643
Stop! Nobody move!

01:03:23.594 --> 01:03:24.675
Freeze!

01:03:24.914 --> 01:03:26.484
Quarterback!

01:03:29.354 --> 01:03:31.356
We are The Four Horsemen.

01:03:31.834 --> 01:03:32.915
Good night.

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:46.519
Get 'em off me!

01:03:47.274 --> 01:03:48.878
Get off! Get off me!

01:03:59.194 --> 01:04:00.605
Get off me!

01:04:08.994 --> 01:04:11.201
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

01:04:17.914 --> 01:04:19.882
- Quarterback!
- Quarterback!

01:04:21.354 --> 01:04:22.844
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater

01:04:22.954 --> 01:04:24.524
and bring the tracker.

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.995
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

01:04:27.074 --> 01:04:28.200
Give me the tracker.

01:04:28.634 --> 01:04:29.635
Let's go.

01:04:33.794 --> 01:04:35.080
FBI! Clear!

01:04:35.794 --> 01:04:36.955
- Dylan!
- Damn.

01:04:37.034 --> 01:04:38.035
What have you got?

01:04:38.114 --> 01:04:39.639
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:42.763
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.239
He's turning left on Burgundy.

01:05:22.954 --> 01:05:24.524
Hey! Move!

01:05:24.594 --> 01:05:25.925
Move! Move!

01:05:28.594 --> 01:05:30.323
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

01:05:30.394 --> 01:05:32.283
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

01:05:32.354 --> 01:05:34.356
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

01:05:45.794 --> 01:05:47.478
I've lost him at Bourbon.

01:05:52.874 --> 01:05:54.876
Damn! Where are you?

01:06:06.834 --> 01:06:08.040
Excuse me.

01:06:14.114 --> 01:06:16.116
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

01:06:18.514 --> 01:06:19.561
Stop!

01:06:26.554 --> 01:06:27.919
What are you doing?

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:33.482
He's going in Napoleon House.

01:06:35.514 --> 01:06:37.084
Move! Move!

01:06:37.954 --> 01:06:39.479
Move out of the way!

01:06:40.194 --> 01:06:41.195
Hey!

01:06:42.034 --> 01:06:43.035
Move!

01:06:45.354 --> 01:06:47.641
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:50.041
No!No!No!

01:06:51.914 --> 01:06:53.075
Freeze!

01:06:53.914 --> 01:06:55.200
Lower your weapons!

01:06:55.474 --> 01:06:56.555
What?

01:06:56.794 --> 01:06:58.796
I'm tracking myself!

01:06:59.314 --> 01:07:01.282
<i>The Horsemen
left egg on the face of what they call</i>

01:07:01.354 --> 01:07:03.004
<i>the alphabet agencies,</i>

01:07:03.114 --> 01:07:04.275
<i>calling into question</i>

01:07:04.394 --> 01:07:06.635
<i>the efficacy of the FBI's task force</i>

01:07:06.754 --> 01:07:09.485
<i>as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,</i>

01:07:09.554 --> 01:07:11.044
<i>Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,</i>

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:12.764
<i>who was publicly ridiculed,</i>

01:07:12.874 --> 01:07:15.764
<i>and even tackled at tonight's performance.</i>

01:07:16.114 --> 01:07:17.354
<i>Talk about a fumble.</i>

01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:19.277
<i>This is quickly becoming a national story,</i>

01:07:19.554 --> 01:07:22.364
<i>as The Horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible</i>

01:07:22.594 --> 01:07:24.881
<i>for the second time in as many days.</i>

01:07:25.114 --> 01:07:26.843
<i>Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen</i>

01:07:26.954 --> 01:07:28.319
<i>seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...</i>

01:07:28.634 --> 01:07:29.795
Hey-

01:07:30.954 --> 01:07:32.080
What are you doing?

01:07:32.154 --> 01:07:33.565
I'm having a drink.

01:07:36.634 --> 01:07:37.999
I came to get you.

01:07:38.594 --> 01:07:39.800
I'm worried about you.

01:07:39.954 --> 01:07:41.479
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

01:07:41.594 --> 01:07:42.720
Atlas. You had him.

01:07:42.794 --> 01:07:44.080
He didn't have a weapon.

01:07:44.154 --> 01:07:45.644
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

01:07:45.754 --> 01:07:48.598
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

01:07:48.754 --> 01:07:49.994
Didn't you?

01:07:50.554 --> 01:07:52.238
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the blue,

01:07:52.314 --> 01:07:54.043
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

01:07:54.114 --> 01:07:55.240
Let go of my arm.

01:07:55.314 --> 01:07:56.998
Who exactly are you anyway?

01:07:59.154 --> 01:08:01.156
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

01:08:06.194 --> 01:08:07.434
Not bad.

01:08:09.354 --> 01:08:10.355
What is this?

01:08:13.394 --> 01:08:14.839
What's the Eye of Horus?

01:08:14.994 --> 01:08:17.998
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

01:08:18.114 --> 01:08:20.685
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

01:08:21.194 --> 01:08:23.356
Find your way back yourself.

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:30.517
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressler would like you
to join him for a drink.

01:08:39.954 --> 01:08:41.001
Sir.

01:08:41.194 --> 01:08:42.434
Thank you.

01:08:43.834 --> 01:08:46.041
What is your role with them?

01:08:46.194 --> 01:08:47.195
Role?

01:08:47.394 --> 01:08:49.123
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

01:08:49.194 --> 01:08:51.003
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:52.878
If it makes you feel any better,

01:08:52.994 --> 01:08:54.200
this wasn't about you.

01:08:54.274 --> 01:08:57.756
Please tell me why this was not about me.

01:08:58.514 --> 01:09:01.085
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

01:09:01.354 --> 01:09:03.675
Played out on a global scale.

01:09:04.034 --> 01:09:08.005
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

01:09:08.554 --> 01:09:11.364
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

01:09:11.554 --> 01:09:15.718
I was a $140-million distraction?

01:09:16.554 --> 01:09:17.715
Yes.

01:09:18.394 --> 01:09:22.558
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

01:09:23.034 --> 01:09:24.559
is what keeps you from seeing that.

01:09:24.714 --> 01:09:26.239
- You know...
-"I can destroy you."

01:09:26.354 --> 01:09:27.765
Yes, I do know.

01:09:27.954 --> 01:09:29.240
Well, you won't.

01:09:29.794 --> 01:09:31.956
And you won't destroy them.

01:09:32.074 --> 01:09:34.122
Whatever this grand trick is,

01:09:34.434 --> 01:09:37.199
it was designed a long time ago.

01:09:37.434 --> 01:09:41.962
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

01:09:42.794 --> 01:09:47.356
So I suggest
you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

01:09:47.794 --> 01:09:50.479
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

01:09:50.674 --> 01:09:52.722
Whatever you stand to make

01:09:54.834 --> 01:09:58.395
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:00.005
And destroy them.

01:10:00.394 --> 01:10:02.396
I stand to make five million.

01:10:03.114 --> 01:10:04.354
Am I flinching?

01:10:06.474 --> 01:10:08.078
No, you're not.

01:11:28.874 --> 01:11:30.000
Hey-

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:33.595
I'm sorry for your arm.

01:11:33.674 --> 01:11:35.244
No. I'm sorry.

01:11:35.314 --> 01:11:37.601
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

01:11:39.554 --> 01:11:42.160
I'm at a loss.

01:11:44.074 --> 01:11:49.478
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

01:11:49.554 --> 01:11:52.842
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

01:11:53.954 --> 01:11:57.845
So what's this all about?

01:11:58.554 --> 01:12:01.239
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

01:12:01.314 --> 01:12:02.679
The Eye are the keepers

01:12:02.754 --> 01:12:03.960
of real magic

01:12:04.034 --> 01:12:06.958
and the protectors of those who practice it.

01:12:07.034 --> 01:12:08.957
"Candidates for initiations

01:12:09.034 --> 01:12:12.197
"must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience."

01:12:13.194 --> 01:12:16.403
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.399
<i>May n</i>

01:12:20.194 --> 01:12:24.518
According to this,
they only take new people twice a century.

01:12:24.594 --> 01:12:27.996
So what? The Horsemen are doing
these shows in order to get into this thing?

01:12:28.074 --> 01:12:29.314
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

01:12:29.394 --> 01:12:34.400
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

01:12:34.474 --> 01:12:36.795
They don't have to put on a show for that.

01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:38.399
It's probably just a myth.

01:12:38.474 --> 01:12:42.604
But it doesn't make any sense,
and I don't think logic will solve this for us.

01:12:42.674 --> 01:12:45.280
- You don't say?
- No.

01:12:46.514 --> 01:12:51.156
I believe
that some things are only discovered

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:55.637
if you take certain leaps.

01:13:02.634 --> 01:13:05.763
- Well, I gotta get to...
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:05.834 --> 01:13:07.996
- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

01:13:08.074 --> 01:13:09.883
- Sorry.
-It's all right.

01:13:12.394 --> 01:13:15.841
If The Eye did exist, we'd have to assume
they were watching us, right?

01:13:15.914 --> 01:13:17.200
Shit.

01:13:17.274 --> 01:13:19.880
I think someone is watching us,
but it isn't magic.

01:13:19.954 --> 01:13:22.958
Your fears are correct.
This is not and has never been your phone.

01:13:23.034 --> 01:13:27.722
It's a clone in every way, except for this.

01:13:27.834 --> 01:13:29.120
A bug.

01:13:29.194 --> 01:13:33.040
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

01:13:33.274 --> 01:13:34.480
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

01:13:34.594 --> 01:13:35.436
God damn it!

01:13:36.794 --> 01:13:38.603
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:40.439
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

01:13:42.274 --> 01:13:43.355
Picture's up.

01:13:43.834 --> 01:13:45.598
Okay, fast forward.

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:47.444
Go on, go on. Freeze!

01:13:48.194 --> 01:13:50.003
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

01:13:50.874 --> 01:13:51.921
Play it through.

01:13:53.034 --> 01:13:55.355
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

01:13:55.794 --> 01:13:57.603
There. That's where he took my phone.

01:13:58.874 --> 01:14:00.080
Is that thing transmitting?

01:14:00.234 --> 01:14:01.645
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

01:14:01.834 --> 01:14:02.801
Plus I removed the bug.

01:14:02.874 --> 01:14:04.444
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

01:14:04.674 --> 01:14:06.483
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

01:14:06.674 --> 01:14:08.676
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

01:14:08.754 --> 01:14:10.916
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:12.645
Find my real phone and track it.

01:14:12.754 --> 01:14:16.076
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

01:14:16.274 --> 01:14:17.321
Good.

01:14:17.714 --> 01:14:19.398
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

01:14:19.474 --> 01:14:20.600
They got power? Cut it.

01:14:20.794 --> 01:14:24.082
They got phones, electricity, water? Cut it.

01:14:24.274 --> 01:14:25.321
Squeeze 'em out.

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.158
I want 'em to feel our presence.

01:14:27.234 --> 01:14:28.759
And get me an airplane!

01:14:31.514 --> 01:14:33.357
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

01:14:33.434 --> 01:14:34.401
They who?

01:14:34.474 --> 01:14:36.283
"They," "them," whoever we're working for.

01:14:36.474 --> 01:14:37.635
Who are we working for?

01:14:37.754 --> 01:14:39.836
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

01:14:39.914 --> 01:14:40.915
Stop being paranoid.

01:14:41.154 --> 01:14:42.235
It really does happen.

01:14:42.434 --> 01:14:44.038
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

01:14:44.154 --> 01:14:45.724
Guys, I don't know if can do this, all right.

01:14:45.794 --> 01:14:47.125
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

01:14:47.194 --> 01:14:49.003
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about

01:14:49.074 --> 01:14:50.280
wanting to be treated like an adult.

01:14:50.354 --> 01:14:51.515
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

01:14:51.594 --> 01:14:53.801
Stick to the plan. Stay here and burn it all.

01:15:06.874 --> 01:15:08.080
I don't know what I'm doing here.

01:15:08.274 --> 01:15:09.241
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

01:15:09.314 --> 01:15:11.794
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

01:15:12.114 --> 01:15:14.276
That's it. Then I'm gone.

01:15:14.354 --> 01:15:16.516
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

01:15:16.714 --> 01:15:18.842
But until then, you stick to the plan.

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:20.962
Hey, guys. They're here.

01:15:22.794 --> 01:15:24.796
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

01:15:24.874 --> 01:15:26.205
- No.
- What?

01:15:26.274 --> 01:15:27.480
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

01:15:27.714 --> 01:15:29.000
She's Interpol. She's with me.

01:15:29.074 --> 01:15:30.075
She stays.

01:15:30.154 --> 01:15:31.440
What? What?

01:15:31.514 --> 01:15:32.515
Stay in the car.

01:15:34.794 --> 01:15:36.000
Let's go.

01:15:41.634 --> 01:15:42.681
Okay. Let's do it.

01:15:47.114 --> 01:15:48.115
FBI!

01:15:52.394 --> 01:15:53.725
Ladies first.

01:15:54.314 --> 01:15:55.520
Don't move!

01:16:01.554 --> 01:16:02.999
Tell me.

01:16:03.114 --> 01:16:04.843
Is my money being well-spent?

01:16:05.354 --> 01:16:07.277
Exceedingly well.

01:16:09.034 --> 01:16:10.524
Now you tell me,

01:16:11.314 --> 01:16:12.998
how do you like your Horsemen?

01:16:13.154 --> 01:16:15.202
Fricasseed or fried?

01:16:15.434 --> 01:16:16.481
Shredded.

01:16:17.554 --> 01:16:19.044
I'll tell the Chef.

01:17:34.594 --> 01:17:35.595
Freeze!

01:17:42.794 --> 01:17:43.795
Dylan!

01:17:44.754 --> 01:17:45.915
Hold on!

01:17:48.234 --> 01:17:49.281
You little...

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:54.795
Come here!

01:17:56.554 --> 01:17:58.477
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.915
You little shit!

01:18:00.994 --> 01:18:03.235
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:05.602
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

01:18:05.674 --> 01:18:07.722
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

01:18:08.394 --> 01:18:10.396
No, no, no, no, no. Go back!

01:18:10.954 --> 01:18:12.115
Hey!

01:18:13.834 --> 01:18:15.074
Come here!

01:18:46.074 --> 01:18:47.235
Come here!

01:18:47.314 --> 01:18:48.998
All right, hold on, hold on!

01:18:50.914 --> 01:18:52.757
- Really?
- Yup.

01:18:56.954 --> 01:18:57.955
You...

01:19:01.754 --> 01:19:03.244
You little...

01:19:19.274 --> 01:19:20.321
Shit!

01:19:38.714 --> 01:19:39.761
Shit!

01:19:41.154 --> 01:19:42.519
Give me that!

01:20:08.514 --> 01:20:10.482
<i>All units, cover the north exit now!</i>

01:20:10.554 --> 01:20:11.840
Clear on Evan.

01:20:11.914 --> 01:20:13.757
<i>Block every possible exit.</i>

01:20:13.834 --> 01:20:15.359
Hey! Get back. Shit.

01:20:16.834 --> 01:20:18.996
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

01:20:19.074 --> 01:20:20.075
What?

01:20:22.194 --> 01:20:23.798
Stop! Stop!

01:20:39.954 --> 01:20:41.001
Hey!

01:21:10.834 --> 01:21:11.756
Good. Follow him!

01:21:11.874 --> 01:21:13.922
Don't ever tell me to stay in the car. Ever.

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:15.325
I didn't have tactical command.

01:21:15.394 --> 01:21:17.795
If you don't trust me, just tell me.

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:19.444
Promise me, next time, you will back me up.

01:21:19.554 --> 01:21:21.602
Could we have
this conversation later, please?

01:21:21.674 --> 01:21:23.244
No!

01:21:23.314 --> 01:21:25.601
Okay, fine, I promise. Now, go!

01:21:33.034 --> 01:21:35.560
- Where'd they go?
- Where are they?

01:21:35.634 --> 01:21:37.318
I don't know. She just took some guy's car.

01:21:37.394 --> 01:21:38.839
- Where are they?
- That way. That way.

01:21:38.914 --> 01:21:39.961
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

01:21:40.074 --> 01:21:41.519
Let's go.

01:22:07.114 --> 01:22:08.115
There he is!

01:22:19.994 --> 01:22:20.995
Move!

01:22:25.394 --> 01:22:26.441
Left!

01:22:28.754 --> 01:22:30.563
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

01:22:30.634 --> 01:22:32.477
- This is not east.
- North! North!

01:22:32.554 --> 01:22:34.602
- We're heading north on the FDR Drive.
- What?

01:22:34.714 --> 01:22:36.796
<i>We're coming to you live above the FDR,</i>

01:22:36.874 --> 01:22:39.798
<i>where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,</i>

01:22:39.874 --> 01:22:41.797
<i>are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,</i>

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:43.114
<i>following a black sedan.</i>

01:22:48.274 --> 01:22:49.275
<i>Fuller, where are you?</i>

01:22:49.554 --> 01:22:51.363
Right here. Trying to catch up to you now.

01:22:51.434 --> 01:22:53.482
<i>We're now trying to get you a better shot.</i>

01:22:55.954 --> 01:22:57.035
Come on!

01:23:12.834 --> 01:23:13.960
<i>It looks like they're turning</i>

01:23:14.034 --> 01:23:16.162
<i>onto the 59th Street Bridge.</i>

01:23:18.194 --> 01:23:19.798
<i>As soon as we have them within range,</i>

01:23:19.874 --> 01:23:21.717
<i>we will bring you those pictures live.</i>

01:23:27.194 --> 01:23:28.434
Good. Just stay with him.

01:23:35.794 --> 01:23:37.034
Go, go, go!

01:23:41.034 --> 01:23:42.604
Behind... You're behind the bus!

01:23:46.194 --> 01:23:47.241
Get over!

01:23:50.794 --> 01:23:51.875
Oh, shit!

01:24:15.554 --> 01:24:16.555
Come here!

01:24:17.794 --> 01:24:19.239
Get back! Get back!

01:24:20.714 --> 01:24:22.000
Dylan, let's go, man!

01:24:22.234 --> 01:24:23.235
Come on, you...

01:24:24.714 --> 01:24:26.762
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

01:24:26.834 --> 01:24:28.245
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

01:24:28.314 --> 01:24:30.237
Let's go! Leave him!

01:24:35.034 --> 01:24:36.399
'The Paper!
- Dylan!

01:24:36.634 --> 01:24:38.557
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

01:25:03.754 --> 01:25:07.998
<i>Today, the unfolding story of a popular
and controversial group of magicians,</i>

01:25:08.114 --> 01:25:10.116
<i>who have been fast capturing
the public's imagination,</i>

01:25:10.194 --> 01:25:13.516
<i>took a dark turn when a police action
that began in Chinatown</i>

01:25:13.594 --> 01:25:17.394
<i>developed into a dramatic, high-speed
chase across the 59th Street Bridge,</i>

01:25:17.474 --> 01:25:20.444
<i>which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of Jack Wilder,</i>

01:25:20.514 --> 01:25:22.835
<i>one of the so-called Four Horsemen.</i>

01:25:24.034 --> 01:25:28.119
<i>The whereabouts of the other three
Horsemen remain unknown at this time.</i>

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:35.679
Dylan, they just
figured out what the paper was in Jack's car.

01:25:35.754 --> 01:25:37.040
So they know what it is?

01:25:37.114 --> 01:25:38.843
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

01:25:38.914 --> 01:25:40.598
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

01:25:40.674 --> 01:25:42.244
Let's go.

01:25:42.314 --> 01:25:43.600
You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

01:25:43.674 --> 01:25:44.675
What's that?

01:25:44.754 --> 01:25:47.041
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

01:25:47.554 --> 01:25:48.794
Rhodes.

01:25:48.874 --> 01:25:50.524
You do understand the function

01:25:50.594 --> 01:25:52.722
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

01:25:53.074 --> 01:25:54.519
Yeah, she's there to distract them

01:25:54.594 --> 01:25:55.800
while he sets up the trick.

01:25:57.074 --> 01:25:59.236
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

01:25:59.634 --> 01:26:01.398
<i>While you're watching the magician,</i>

01:26:02.234 --> 01:26:04.475
<i>that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.</i>

01:26:04.714 --> 01:26:07.843
<i>Don't you find it peculiar
that Interpol would send you</i>

01:26:07.914 --> 01:26:11.361
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:13.996
Why did she request to be put on the case?

01:26:14.394 --> 01:26:16.317
She was assigned to the case.

01:26:17.194 --> 01:26:18.605
Luck of the draw.

01:26:19.154 --> 01:26:22.283
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

01:26:22.434 --> 01:26:25.995
I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

01:26:26.074 --> 01:26:27.235
What's in it for you?

01:26:27.394 --> 01:26:29.237
Just trying to even the game.

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:33.439
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

01:26:34.594 --> 01:26:38.360
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

01:26:42.194 --> 01:26:43.275
Hey-

01:26:43.554 --> 01:26:44.794
We got a problem.

01:26:45.954 --> 01:26:47.035
Here's the safe.

01:26:47.114 --> 01:26:48.559
No, no, no. Hey.

01:26:48.674 --> 01:26:49.960
What's he doing here?

01:26:50.114 --> 01:26:51.718
Giving us our first solid lead.

01:26:51.794 --> 01:26:53.683
We've been investigating
a private security contractor

01:26:53.754 --> 01:26:54.915
called Elkhorn

01:26:54.994 --> 01:26:56.962
-for the last five years.
- And?

01:26:57.034 --> 01:26:58.718
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

01:26:58.794 --> 01:27:01.240
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

01:27:01.634 --> 01:27:03.955
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

01:27:04.114 --> 01:27:06.640
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

01:27:06.794 --> 01:27:08.717
The magician who died on the bridge...

01:27:08.794 --> 01:27:12.276
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

01:27:12.634 --> 01:27:14.636
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

01:27:14.914 --> 01:27:16.803
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

01:27:16.874 --> 01:27:18.114
How did they get the file?

01:27:19.394 --> 01:27:20.395
This is the part you're gonna find

01:27:20.474 --> 01:27:22.442
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

01:27:22.634 --> 01:27:24.955
They patched to my server
after they accessed

01:27:25.034 --> 01:27:27.321
your mobile command center
in New Orleans

01:27:27.394 --> 01:27:28.998
with codes they got from your phone.

01:27:31.154 --> 01:27:32.997
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

01:27:33.394 --> 01:27:36.000
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

01:27:36.074 --> 01:27:38.600
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

01:27:38.674 --> 01:27:40.915
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

01:27:42.354 --> 01:27:44.243
Boss, he's taking over?

01:27:44.794 --> 01:27:46.796
Let's go, gentlemen.

01:27:48.154 --> 01:27:49.565
Hey-

01:27:49.634 --> 01:27:51.079
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

01:27:51.194 --> 01:27:52.355
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:54.482
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

01:27:54.554 --> 01:27:56.716
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

01:27:56.794 --> 01:27:58.239
Do you understand it?

01:27:58.314 --> 01:27:59.361
Yes.

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:01.715
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

01:28:01.794 --> 01:28:04.195
If I find out that you are anything other than

01:28:04.274 --> 01:28:05.560
who you say you are, I swear...

01:28:05.674 --> 01:28:07.483
And we French also have an expression.

01:28:09.314 --> 01:28:10.998
"Faith can move mountains."

01:28:11.074 --> 01:28:12.758
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

01:28:12.834 --> 01:28:14.677
then you need to have a little faith in me.

01:28:14.914 --> 01:28:16.916
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

01:28:16.994 --> 01:28:19.759
I just got my ass handed to me.

01:28:19.834 --> 01:28:21.359
I am losing this case.

01:28:21.474 --> 01:28:24.796
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

01:28:30.994 --> 01:28:33.235
<i>More than anything in his life,</i>

01:28:33.314 --> 01:28:38.684
Jack wanted to be
the most famous magician who ever lived.

01:28:38.754 --> 01:28:40.165
And I can't say he achieved it,

01:28:40.234 --> 01:28:44.205
but I do hope wherever he is,
it is full of magic.

01:28:45.954 --> 01:28:48.275
But the point is... Sorry.

01:28:48.354 --> 01:28:49.844
The point is...

01:28:49.914 --> 01:28:56.115
The point of why we are here is to say
that we are not... We cannot quit now.

01:28:56.194 --> 01:28:58.765
<i>We've started something
bigger than all of us.</i>

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.677
<i>We have to finish it.</i>

01:29:09.714 --> 01:29:10.795
<i>Approaching the warehouse.</i>

01:29:10.874 --> 01:29:13.400
<i>Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.</i>

01:29:13.474 --> 01:29:14.714
<i>We are going for the vault.</i>

01:29:19.794 --> 01:29:22.718
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

01:29:26.914 --> 01:29:27.915
What is this?

01:29:27.994 --> 01:29:29.359
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

01:29:29.434 --> 01:29:31.323
We just moved it while you were outside.

01:29:31.394 --> 01:29:32.555
- Evans' orders.
- What?

01:29:32.634 --> 01:29:33.715
I never said that.

01:29:33.794 --> 01:29:35.125
Sir, you got a phone call

01:29:35.234 --> 01:29:36.838
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

01:29:36.914 --> 01:29:38.996
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, Agent.

01:29:39.074 --> 01:29:39.757
What happened?

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:42.561
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

01:29:42.634 --> 01:29:43.715
No!

01:29:49.594 --> 01:29:51.084
Jesus Christ.

01:29:51.314 --> 01:29:54.284
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

01:29:54.354 --> 01:29:56.243
I think it's Beethoven's Concerto in D-Major.

01:29:56.314 --> 01:29:57.315
Where's the safe?

01:29:57.394 --> 01:29:58.475
His team is loading the truck.

01:30:02.754 --> 01:30:04.438
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

01:30:05.994 --> 01:30:07.155
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

01:30:08.154 --> 01:30:10.316
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

01:30:18.954 --> 01:30:20.843
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

01:30:20.914 --> 01:30:22.678
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

01:30:26.634 --> 01:30:28.443
Okay. Here's what I want.

01:30:28.514 --> 01:30:30.755
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

01:30:30.994 --> 01:30:32.120
So we stay with it.

01:30:32.194 --> 01:30:34.117
We follow it
all the way to... Where's it going?

01:30:34.394 --> 01:30:35.475
5 Pointz. Up the street.

01:30:35.914 --> 01:30:38.804
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

01:30:38.994 --> 01:30:40.120
It'll lead us right to 'em.

01:30:40.994 --> 01:30:42.200
You two are with me.

01:30:54.834 --> 01:30:56.074
Guys.

01:30:57.034 --> 01:30:59.514
Look. Office just called with this.

01:30:59.634 --> 01:31:01.477
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:05.481
<i>The point of why we're here
is to say that we are not...</i>

01:31:05.714 --> 01:31:07.557
<i>We cannot quit now.</i>

01:31:07.714 --> 01:31:10.194
<i>We've started something
bigger than all of us.</i>

01:31:10.394 --> 01:31:11.964
<i>We have to finish it.</i>

01:31:12.034 --> 01:31:14.605
<i>Remember the name Jack Wilder
when you see us live,</i>

01:31:14.674 --> 01:31:16.563
<i>5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.</i>

01:31:16.794 --> 01:31:17.875
Their show is in a half an hour.

01:31:17.954 --> 01:31:19.240
It's exactly where we're headed.

01:31:19.394 --> 01:31:21.522
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

01:31:21.714 --> 01:31:23.682
but these guys are kinda tricky.

01:31:23.754 --> 01:31:26.405
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

01:31:28.914 --> 01:31:31.076
<i>A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz</i>

01:31:31.154 --> 01:31:35.000
<i>as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.</i>

01:31:35.074 --> 01:31:36.485
<i>The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round</i>

01:31:36.554 --> 01:31:38.761
<i>of their three-act face-off with the FBI.</i>

01:31:39.234 --> 01:31:42.602
<i>What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.</i>

01:31:53.914 --> 01:31:56.155
<i>AH eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.</i>

01:31:56.274 --> 01:31:57.605
Copy that.

01:32:13.754 --> 01:32:15.597
<i>Agents Rhodes, Fuller?</i>

01:32:16.274 --> 01:32:17.275
Go, for us.

01:32:17.434 --> 01:32:20.085
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

01:32:20.194 --> 01:32:21.684
<i>It's a woman.</i>

01:32:25.394 --> 01:32:26.600
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

01:32:28.354 --> 01:32:29.879
What the hell's going on?

01:32:30.954 --> 01:32:33.275
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

01:32:33.394 --> 01:32:34.441
Put your guns down.

01:32:34.634 --> 01:32:37.478
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

01:32:37.634 --> 01:32:38.635
Are you kidding?

01:32:38.714 --> 01:32:40.557
I'm following them, just like you are.

01:32:40.634 --> 01:32:42.238
I'm not following anybody anymore.

01:32:42.314 --> 01:32:44.043
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

01:32:44.154 --> 01:32:45.758
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

01:32:45.954 --> 01:32:47.604
Your ass is mine.

01:32:47.794 --> 01:32:49.558
You guys are still idiots.

01:32:49.754 --> 01:32:50.801
Yeah?

01:32:50.874 --> 01:32:52.000
This happens to be the former

01:32:52.114 --> 01:32:54.162
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

01:32:54.594 --> 01:32:56.437
It's where I did my first show.

01:32:56.634 --> 01:32:59.444
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

01:32:59.634 --> 01:33:00.920
why not open it?

01:33:01.274 --> 01:33:02.924
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

01:33:03.194 --> 01:33:04.844
would you mind reenacting your look

01:33:05.034 --> 01:33:06.957
of absolute befuddlement for me?

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:09.196
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

01:33:10.554 --> 01:33:11.794
Open the safe.

01:33:11.874 --> 01:33:13.364
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

01:33:17.714 --> 01:33:18.761
What the hell?

01:33:21.154 --> 01:33:22.280
What?

01:33:22.514 --> 01:33:23.595
Give me that.

01:33:23.794 --> 01:33:24.841
No.

01:33:24.994 --> 01:33:25.995
No!

01:33:30.634 --> 01:33:31.681
What is this?

01:33:32.794 --> 01:33:33.795
Get back!

01:33:41.394 --> 01:33:43.522
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

01:33:44.194 --> 01:33:46.515
They have you chasing empty safes again.

01:33:47.874 --> 01:33:51.037
Once again, misdirection.

01:33:57.994 --> 01:33:59.644
The show is starting. Move out!

01:33:59.714 --> 01:34:02.240
The question
I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

01:34:02.714 --> 01:34:04.842
"What happened to the real one?"

01:34:25.474 --> 01:34:27.238
Clear! Clear 'em out!

01:34:27.314 --> 01:34:28.918
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

01:34:30.314 --> 01:34:32.203
FBI! Give me a path!

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:34.404
Clear out! Clear out!

01:34:34.674 --> 01:34:36.039
<i>What is magic?</i>

01:34:36.874 --> 01:34:37.921
<i>Magic is deception.</i>

01:34:38.034 --> 01:34:39.763
<i>But deception designed to delight,</i>

01:34:39.994 --> 01:34:41.678
<i>to entertain, to inspire.</i>

01:34:41.874 --> 01:34:44.241
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

01:34:44.594 --> 01:34:45.675
<i>It is about belief.</i>

01:34:45.754 --> 01:34:46.755
<i>Faith.</i>

01:34:46.874 --> 01:34:47.875
<i>Trust.</i>

01:34:51.874 --> 01:34:53.285
<i>Without those qualities,</i>

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:56.756
<i>magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.</i>

01:34:57.354 --> 01:34:59.197
<i>But what happens if these qualities</i>

01:34:59.394 --> 01:35:01.362
<i>are not used for their higher purpose?</i>

01:35:01.554 --> 01:35:04.364
<i>And instead they're used to cheat, lie.</i>

01:35:04.554 --> 01:35:06.795
<i>For personal gain or for greed.</i>

01:35:06.954 --> 01:35:08.604
<i>Then it's no longer magic.</i>

01:35:08.794 --> 01:35:09.875
<i>It's crime.</i>

01:35:10.074 --> 01:35:13.078
<i>So tonight, for our final act,</i>

01:35:13.154 --> 01:35:15.998
<i>you're gonna help us set a few things right.</i>

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:21.275
What's going on here, Rhodes?

01:35:21.554 --> 01:35:22.715
I don't know.

01:35:23.794 --> 01:35:24.955
Showtime.

01:35:30.154 --> 01:35:31.155
Look!

01:35:35.474 --> 01:35:37.397
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

01:35:37.474 --> 01:35:38.760
Go, go, go!

01:35:39.474 --> 01:35:40.805
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

01:35:42.394 --> 01:35:43.441
What are you doing here?

01:35:43.554 --> 01:35:44.635
They're going in the wrong direction

01:35:44.794 --> 01:35:45.841
and you know it.

01:35:46.114 --> 01:35:48.435
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

01:35:48.554 --> 01:35:51.922
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

01:35:52.754 --> 01:35:53.835
Wait.

01:35:54.114 --> 01:35:55.275
I'm going to go with her.

01:35:55.434 --> 01:35:56.720
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

01:35:58.554 --> 01:35:59.601
Go ahead!

01:35:59.674 --> 01:36:01.164
That's on you, Fuller.

01:36:16.554 --> 01:36:20.604
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

01:36:31.714 --> 01:36:32.795
Daniel?

01:36:33.634 --> 01:36:34.795
Yeah?

01:36:34.914 --> 01:36:39.556
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

01:36:39.754 --> 01:36:43.076
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

01:36:43.274 --> 01:36:45.959
I'd like to express a sentiment

01:36:46.034 --> 01:36:47.638
to you about our relationship.

01:36:47.874 --> 01:36:48.921
Okay.

01:36:49.314 --> 01:36:52.796
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

01:36:54.634 --> 01:36:55.635
dick.

01:36:57.154 --> 01:36:58.201
And?

01:36:59.994 --> 01:37:01.644
No, that's it.

01:37:01.874 --> 01:37:02.921
That's very nice.

01:37:02.994 --> 01:37:04.484
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

01:37:04.634 --> 01:37:06.124
Yeah. Just from the heart.

01:37:06.314 --> 01:37:07.918
Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

01:37:08.034 --> 01:37:09.081
Oh. you!

01:37:12.674 --> 01:37:14.324
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

01:37:14.554 --> 01:37:15.680
We're on our own.

01:37:15.754 --> 01:37:17.404
Our instructions run out after the show.

01:37:18.314 --> 01:37:20.203
Even if there is no "Eye,"

01:37:20.274 --> 01:37:22.003
if we were completely played and we spend

01:37:22.114 --> 01:37:24.116
the next 20 years in jail, then,

01:37:24.674 --> 01:37:26.358
I just want to say that...

01:37:26.594 --> 01:37:28.961
I know. Me, too.

01:37:30.314 --> 01:37:32.237
Little too sentimental for me.

01:37:39.194 --> 01:37:40.275
There they are!

01:37:43.274 --> 01:37:46.039
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

01:37:46.154 --> 01:37:47.155
Grab 'em!

01:37:52.154 --> 01:37:53.201
Get up!

01:37:53.634 --> 01:37:54.840
What the hell?

01:37:58.634 --> 01:37:59.795
Shit!

01:38:08.994 --> 01:38:10.234
Hello, New York!

01:38:18.714 --> 01:38:20.682
Thank you for the magic.

01:38:20.874 --> 01:38:21.955
And thank you for being such

01:38:22.074 --> 01:38:25.078
an incredible and dedicated audience.

01:38:25.474 --> 01:38:27.476
Unfortunately, like all good things,

01:38:27.554 --> 01:38:29.363
it must come to an end.

01:38:32.074 --> 01:38:34.554
So we would like to start our show tonight...

01:38:34.634 --> 01:38:36.204
By saying goodbye.

01:38:37.554 --> 01:38:38.919
All we wanted was to

01:38:38.994 --> 01:38:40.962
bring the world to a magic show.

01:38:41.034 --> 01:38:42.524
And thereby bring a little magic

01:38:42.594 --> 01:38:43.755
back to the world.

01:38:47.754 --> 01:38:48.915
Clear the way!

01:38:58.674 --> 01:39:01.883
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

01:39:02.434 --> 01:39:04.755
But it's time for us to disappear.

01:39:04.914 --> 01:39:06.279
Good night, New York.

01:39:06.514 --> 01:39:07.959
And thank you for believing in us.

01:39:10.594 --> 01:39:11.720
Stop!

01:39:15.234 --> 01:39:16.235
Freeze!

01:39:16.634 --> 01:39:17.840
No!

01:39:35.914 --> 01:39:37.245
God damn it!

01:40:05.834 --> 01:40:07.040
I'm sorry.

01:40:07.714 --> 01:40:09.716
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

01:40:10.674 --> 01:40:14.759
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

01:40:17.074 --> 01:40:18.724
So I guess this is it.

01:40:20.754 --> 01:40:21.915
Is it?

01:40:48.034 --> 01:40:49.320
Dylan!

01:40:49.714 --> 01:40:52.160
Dylan! Dylan!

01:40:52.234 --> 01:40:53.281
Hey-

01:40:54.634 --> 01:40:56.602
- You see that?
- What?

01:41:00.234 --> 01:41:01.599
Where's the real money?

01:41:17.834 --> 01:41:21.805
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

01:42:12.994 --> 01:42:14.120
I've been framed.

01:42:15.474 --> 01:42:16.521
I'm sure you were.

01:42:16.594 --> 01:42:17.880
Yeah, but I can prove it.

01:42:18.394 --> 01:42:19.634
I always do.

01:42:19.994 --> 01:42:21.962
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

01:42:22.034 --> 01:42:24.560
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

01:42:24.794 --> 01:42:26.956
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

01:42:27.194 --> 01:42:29.674
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

01:42:29.754 --> 01:42:31.597
Sure.

01:42:36.554 --> 01:42:37.601
All right.

01:42:38.634 --> 01:42:40.284
I got information to trade.

01:42:40.394 --> 01:42:41.555
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

01:42:41.794 --> 01:42:43.398
If it's of some value.

01:42:45.874 --> 01:42:49.037
These bars give a man time to think.

01:42:50.234 --> 01:42:53.522
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

01:42:53.954 --> 01:42:56.082
<i>Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?</i>

01:42:57.234 --> 01:42:59.077
<i>The box was never empty.</i>

01:43:01.434 --> 01:43:02.595
<i>The room wasn't either.</i>

01:43:03.874 --> 01:43:06.275
<i>After gaining access to the warehouse,</i>

01:43:06.594 --> 01:43:08.676
<i>The Horsemen left the real safe</i>

01:43:08.754 --> 01:43:11.200
<i>and transformed the whole room</i>

01:43:11.274 --> 01:43:13.754
<i>into a giant rabbit box.</i>

01:43:15.354 --> 01:43:17.516
<i>You go charging in there,</i>

01:43:17.754 --> 01:43:20.200
<i>thinking the safe was already gone.</i>

01:43:20.434 --> 01:43:21.401
Hey!

01:43:21.474 --> 01:43:22.805
Hey! Stop!

01:43:22.994 --> 01:43:24.405
Missing the trick. Again.

01:43:24.474 --> 01:43:25.521
Which was to make you think

01:43:25.794 --> 01:43:27.319
the safe had already been stolen,

01:43:27.394 --> 01:43:29.635
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

01:43:30.194 --> 01:43:33.164
<i>Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,</i>

01:43:33.354 --> 01:43:35.960
<i>someone was breaking into the warehouse.</i>

01:43:54.474 --> 01:43:55.635
<i>Who?</i>

01:43:57.074 --> 01:43:58.564
<i>Jack Wilder.</i>

01:43:59.314 --> 01:44:00.645
Holy shit.

01:44:00.834 --> 01:44:03.235
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

01:44:04.034 --> 01:44:06.162
Unless, of course, he didn't.

01:44:13.474 --> 01:44:14.760
It's locked.

01:44:15.554 --> 01:44:16.760
Weren't you listening?

01:44:17.234 --> 01:44:18.315
Nothing's ever locked.

01:44:19.714 --> 01:44:22.524
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

01:44:22.674 --> 01:44:24.517
You're a big boy now, Jack.

01:44:24.674 --> 01:44:27.041
He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

01:44:30.834 --> 01:44:32.199
<i>Led you to the bridge.</i>

01:44:32.434 --> 01:44:34.038
<i>Where the other Horsemen were waiting</i>

01:44:34.194 --> 01:44:36.083
<i>with an identical replacement car.</i>

01:44:37.074 --> 01:44:38.075
<i>It only took a split second</i>

01:44:38.194 --> 01:44:39.161
<i>for you to lose contact with it</i>

01:44:39.234 --> 01:44:40.235
<i>and make the switch.</i>

01:45:02.554 --> 01:45:05.558
<i>When you crawled into that burning car,</i>

01:45:05.914 --> 01:45:07.916
<i>quite heroically, I might add,</i>

01:45:09.794 --> 01:45:11.876
<i>you almost died trying to rescue</i>

01:45:11.954 --> 01:45:14.958
<i>what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.</i>

01:45:16.474 --> 01:45:20.160
<i>Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan</i>

01:45:20.874 --> 01:45:22.399
just to frame one guy?

01:45:22.714 --> 01:45:23.761
I don't know.

01:45:23.914 --> 01:45:25.325
They never kept any of the money they took.

01:45:25.394 --> 01:45:27.840
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

01:45:27.914 --> 01:45:30.599
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

01:45:30.754 --> 01:45:32.438
- No. Not really.
- What?

01:45:32.514 --> 01:45:37.076
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

01:45:37.354 --> 01:45:40.119
His comeback attempt. His accident.

01:45:41.074 --> 01:45:44.601
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

01:45:44.794 --> 01:45:46.000
Tressler Insurance.

01:45:47.914 --> 01:45:50.155
The bank that carried the note?

01:45:51.274 --> 01:45:52.924
Credit Republican of Paris.

01:45:53.114 --> 01:45:54.764
Credit Republicain de Paris.

01:45:56.114 --> 01:45:57.525
What do you make of that?

01:45:57.594 --> 01:45:59.756
A sucker is born every minute.

01:46:00.514 --> 01:46:03.120
What if all this was just leading up to

01:46:03.194 --> 01:46:05.925
us getting mugged
in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

01:46:05.994 --> 01:46:08.679
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

01:46:08.754 --> 01:46:09.880
We just have to find...

01:46:09.954 --> 01:46:11.080
That?

01:46:13.594 --> 01:46:15.323
The Lionel Shrike tree.

01:46:16.274 --> 01:46:18.800
And the card encased in glass.

01:46:20.114 --> 01:46:21.764
What do we do now?

01:46:38.394 --> 01:46:39.839
Oh, nice!

01:46:55.714 --> 01:46:57.159
<i>So, here's my new theory.</i>

01:46:57.674 --> 01:47:01.076
The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

01:47:01.754 --> 01:47:02.915
Waiting

01:47:03.314 --> 01:47:07.080
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

01:47:08.034 --> 01:47:09.843
from the mediocre ones.

01:47:10.674 --> 01:47:11.880
Maybe that was you.

01:47:12.514 --> 01:47:14.755
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

01:47:14.834 --> 01:47:17.485
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

01:47:17.554 --> 01:47:20.717
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

01:47:21.194 --> 01:47:22.684
You pissed them off.

01:47:24.394 --> 01:47:27.443
The Eye isn't real.

01:47:27.514 --> 01:47:30.597
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

01:47:30.874 --> 01:47:32.205
Somebody with an obsession.

01:47:32.434 --> 01:47:33.879
- Meticulous.
- Who?

01:47:33.954 --> 01:47:37.276
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

01:47:37.354 --> 01:47:39.960
Somebody so prepared to lose

01:47:40.034 --> 01:47:42.514
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

01:47:42.634 --> 01:47:45.444
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

01:47:45.554 --> 01:47:47.204
I don't know who.

01:47:47.594 --> 01:47:49.801
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

01:47:49.874 --> 01:47:51.205
to plant the mirrors.

01:47:52.554 --> 01:47:56.400
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

01:47:56.474 --> 01:47:59.717
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

01:48:00.034 --> 01:48:02.685
Almost as if they were on the...

01:48:15.554 --> 01:48:16.965
The inside.

01:48:29.074 --> 01:48:30.121
You.

01:48:34.754 --> 01:48:35.755
Why?

01:48:36.594 --> 01:48:38.915
That is the question, isn't it?

01:48:39.754 --> 01:48:41.324
You're right.

01:48:41.914 --> 01:48:44.281
I can't tell you how long I've waited

01:48:44.354 --> 01:48:46.322
to see the look on your face.

01:48:48.754 --> 01:48:50.279
Who are you?

01:48:51.354 --> 01:48:52.765
What do you want from me?

01:48:53.594 --> 01:48:55.119
What do I want?

01:48:55.514 --> 01:48:58.438
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

01:48:58.514 --> 01:49:02.519
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

01:49:03.194 --> 01:49:06.277
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

01:49:06.874 --> 01:49:09.275
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

01:49:09.354 --> 01:49:12.119
when you were always two steps behind.

01:49:16.794 --> 01:49:18.000
Dylan?

01:49:18.954 --> 01:49:19.955
Wait a minute.

01:49:20.994 --> 01:49:23.156
Dylan! How did this happen?

01:49:30.794 --> 01:49:32.478
Dylan!

01:49:32.594 --> 01:49:33.595
Why?

01:49:34.314 --> 01:49:35.315
Why?

01:49:39.314 --> 01:49:41.476
Oh, my God.

01:49:42.474 --> 01:49:44.363
I did not see that coming.

01:49:44.474 --> 01:49:45.760
That's impossible!

01:49:45.834 --> 01:49:46.835
No way.

01:49:46.914 --> 01:49:49.315
That was actually pretty good.

01:49:49.754 --> 01:49:50.835
Thank you.

01:49:51.234 --> 01:49:53.475
When I said,
"Always be the smartest guy in the room."

01:49:53.554 --> 01:49:54.601
We were in agreement.

01:49:54.834 --> 01:49:55.995
Okay. Right.

01:49:56.394 --> 01:49:57.395
Henley.

01:49:58.154 --> 01:49:59.997
I've never seen her speechless.

01:50:00.074 --> 01:50:01.678
I take that as a huge compliment.

01:50:02.394 --> 01:50:05.045
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

01:50:05.834 --> 01:50:07.359
Hey, listen, for the record,

01:50:07.514 --> 01:50:11.041
I have always been a 100% believer.

01:50:11.194 --> 01:50:13.435
And the amount of energy
I have expended to keep

01:50:13.514 --> 01:50:15.642
these infidels on point...

01:50:15.714 --> 01:50:17.762
Merritt, you're in.

01:50:18.594 --> 01:50:19.675
God bless.

01:50:19.794 --> 01:50:20.841
Come.

01:50:21.874 --> 01:50:25.037
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

01:50:25.234 --> 01:50:27.123
and making them all work together.

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:29.675
And that's exactly what you did.

01:50:30.634 --> 01:50:31.715
So welcome.

01:50:35.034 --> 01:50:37.082
Welcome to the Eye.

01:51:44.274 --> 01:51:46.356
It was all connected.

01:51:46.994 --> 01:51:49.998
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

01:51:59.354 --> 01:52:00.685
And Elkhorn?

01:52:00.794 --> 01:52:02.717
What's the connection to Shrike?

01:52:05.194 --> 01:52:08.437
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

01:52:08.754 --> 01:52:10.882
They used cheap steel.

01:52:12.474 --> 01:52:13.760
They cut corners.

01:52:13.834 --> 01:52:17.077
When he got
to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

01:52:17.154 --> 01:52:18.519
And he was trapped.

01:52:20.074 --> 01:52:21.644
He was your father.

01:52:23.514 --> 01:52:26.882
<i>The morning before the show
didn't feel like any other day.</i>

01:52:27.914 --> 01:52:32.920
<i>When my father said he had to go to work,
he could see that I didn't want him to leave.</i>

01:52:35.154 --> 01:52:40.285
<i>So he gave me his watch, and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back.</i>

01:52:41.474 --> 01:52:44.159
<i>I have never let his watch stop since then.</i>

01:52:44.234 --> 01:52:46.396
And from that moment on,

01:52:46.474 --> 01:52:49.000
I created a persona.

01:52:49.634 --> 01:52:51.557
I planned. I worked out every detail.

01:52:51.634 --> 01:52:54.922
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

01:52:55.354 --> 01:52:56.515
was you.

01:52:58.194 --> 01:53:01.164
And I know that
the logical conclusion for you

01:53:01.634 --> 01:53:04.399
is to take this case to its resolution.

01:53:04.474 --> 01:53:07.523
And for you to turn me in.

01:53:12.674 --> 01:53:13.721
Yeah.

01:53:15.674 --> 01:53:19.520
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

01:53:20.874 --> 01:53:22.205
And you also know

01:53:23.074 --> 01:53:27.443
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

01:53:33.914 --> 01:53:35.723
One more secret to lock away.

01:54:03.274 --> 01:54:04.799
<i>Come in close.</i>

01:54:05.274 --> 01:54:06.560
<i>Closer.</i>

01:54:06.634 --> 01:54:08.875
<i>Because now you know our secret.</i>

01:54:08.954 --> 01:54:11.321
<i>We could be anywhere. Watching you.</i>

01:54:11.914 --> 01:54:15.555
<i>We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.</i>

01:54:15.634 --> 01:54:18.205
<i>On the count of three, open your eyes</i>

01:54:18.274 --> 01:54:20.242
<i>and tell me what you see.</i>

01:54:21.234 --> 01:54:22.315
One.

01:54:22.434 --> 01:54:23.435
<i>Two...</i>

01:55:55.274 --> 01:55:57.163
Please, stop, stop, stop.

01:55:57.514 --> 01:56:01.235
All right, stop the van. Stop the van.
I'm gonna jump out of the van.

01:56:02.234 --> 01:56:03.724
Oh, thank God.

01:56:05.674 --> 01:56:07.756
Where are we?

01:56:07.834 --> 01:56:10.235
Great, another shit hole.

01:56:10.314 --> 01:56:12.237
Okay, feeling it.

01:56:12.354 --> 01:56:16.518
I'm exhausted, and hungry, and cranky.

01:56:17.554 --> 01:56:19.443
Check out this place.

01:56:19.605 --> 01:56:22.382
- Where'd you bring us?
- Was there no landfill where we were?

01:56:22.394 --> 01:56:24.283
This place is awesome.

01:56:25.794 --> 01:56:26.795
Is this our new gear?

01:56:26.874 --> 01:56:28.444
There'd better not be, like,
matching jumpsuits in there.

01:56:28.514 --> 01:56:29.561
You know I don't wear spandex.

01:56:29.634 --> 01:56:32.035
It's locked.
- Guys, the cards.

01:56:32.114 --> 01:56:34.640
- What card?
- What do you mean, "what card"?

01:56:38.949 --> 01:56:39.535
Okay.
