Encoded by RippeR

00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:27.271
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:41.668
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:47.174
Are the rumors true, Albus?

00:01:47.427 --> 00:01:52.634
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

00:01:52.848 --> 00:01:56.099
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

00:01:56.352 --> 00:02:00.265
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

00:02:00.772 --> 00:02:05.684
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:28.675
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:32.752
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:37.432
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:40.718
Try not to wake him.

00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:43.598
There you go.

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:53.572
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

00:02:53.784 --> 00:02:59.027
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:03.239
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:08.413
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:10.381
Exactly.

00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:14.885
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.100
Until he's ready.

00:03:32.114 --> 00:03:37.617
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.958
Good luck...

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:54.123
...Harry Potter.

00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:14.695
Up. Get up!

00:04:17.325 --> 00:04:18.819
Now!

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.875
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

00:04:47.062 --> 00:04:52.353
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:57.360
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

00:04:57.572 --> 00:05:02.529
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

00:05:02.743 --> 00:05:05.661
...for my Dudley's special day!

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:10.865
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:15.206
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:20.883
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:24.299
36?! But last year I had 37!

00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:28.383
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

00:05:28.604 --> 00:05:31.094
This is what we're going to do.

00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:35.691
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:43.276
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:48.405
I'm warning you now, boy.

00:05:48.622 --> 00:05:52.121
Any funny business, any at all...

00:05:52.334 --> 00:05:55.370
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:57.873
Get in.

00:06:05.056 --> 00:06:07.462
Make it move.

00:06:10.143 --> 00:06:11.851
Move!

00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:14.559
- Move!
- He's asleep!

00:06:14.773 --> 00:06:17.311
He's boring.

00:06:19.736 --> 00:06:21.195
Sorry about him.

00:06:21.404 --> 00:06:25.104
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.484
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:34.918
Can you hear me?

00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:41.465
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

00:06:41.925 --> 00:06:43.336
Do you?

00:06:43.552 --> 00:06:47.680
Do you talk to people often?

00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:52.092
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.599
Do you miss your family?

00:06:57.482 --> 00:07:02.190
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

00:07:02.403 --> 00:07:07.397
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

00:07:30.514 --> 00:07:32.507
Thanks.

00:07:32.724 --> 00:07:34.136
Anytime.

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:39.388
Snake!

00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:58.205
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

00:07:58.458 --> 00:08:01.578
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

00:08:02.087 --> 00:08:07.163
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:17.346
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

00:08:19.104 --> 00:08:22.022
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

00:08:22.233 --> 00:08:26.099
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

00:08:30.532 --> 00:08:33.319
There's no such thing as magic.

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:12.781
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:16.193
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.161
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

00:09:50.444 --> 00:09:54.987
No more mail through this letterbox.

00:10:07.168 --> 00:10:10.003
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

00:10:12.883 --> 00:10:15.552
Shoo! Go on.

00:10:40.409 --> 00:10:43.279
Fine day, Sunday.

00:10:43.913 --> 00:10:48.575
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

00:10:48.793 --> 00:10:53.206
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

00:10:53.422 --> 00:10:56.173
No post on Sunday.

00:10:57.593 --> 00:11:01.507
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

00:11:02.097 --> 00:11:07.055
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

00:11:15.485 --> 00:11:19.352
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

00:11:30.876 --> 00:11:33.082
Make it stop, please!

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.789
Stop it!

00:11:40.928 --> 00:11:43.882
Mummy, what's happening?

00:11:47.309 --> 00:11:51.638
Give me that! Give me that letter!

00:11:54.273 --> 00:11:56.017
Get off!

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:03.943
They're my letters! Let go of me!

00:12:04.784 --> 00:12:07.785
That's it! We're going away!

00:12:08.455 --> 00:12:12.120
Far away, where they can't find us!

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:15.583
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

00:12:50.496 --> 00:12:52.785
Make a wish, Harry.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.929
Who's there?

00:13:23.112 --> 00:13:25.519
Sorry about that.

00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:36.989
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

00:13:39.877 --> 00:13:42.712
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:51.426
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:56.182
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

00:13:56.394 --> 00:13:59.229
I'm not Harry.

00:14:01.065 --> 00:14:04.765
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

00:14:05.568 --> 00:14:07.146
Got something for you.

00:14:07.362 --> 00:14:12.948
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:18.870
Baked it myself, words and all.

00:14:24.422 --> 00:14:25.453
Thank you.

00:14:25.715 --> 00:14:29.843
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

00:14:45.025 --> 00:14:49.153
Excuse me, but who are you?

00:14:49.362 --> 00:14:54.273
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

00:14:54.534 --> 00:14:58.235
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:03.741
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:05.378
Learned what?

00:15:05.587 --> 00:15:08.125
You're a wizard, Harry.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.380
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

00:15:11.593 --> 00:15:14.629
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

00:15:14.887 --> 00:15:17.758
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

00:15:17.974 --> 00:15:20.975
...I can't be a wizard.

00:15:21.644 --> 00:15:26.389
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

00:15:27.482 --> 00:15:31.480
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

00:15:31.695 --> 00:15:36.357
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:55.878
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

00:15:56.095 --> 00:15:59.345
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

00:15:59.557 --> 00:16:04.514
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

00:16:04.728 --> 00:16:08.939
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

00:16:09.149 --> 00:16:12.233
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

00:16:12.445 --> 00:16:16.146
My perfect sister being who she was.

00:16:16.366 --> 00:16:22.319
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

00:16:22.537 --> 00:16:26.701
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

00:16:26.917 --> 00:16:30.582
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

00:16:30.796 --> 00:16:32.539
A freak!

00:16:32.755 --> 00:16:35.709
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:41.630
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

00:16:41.848 --> 00:16:46.842
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

00:16:47.062 --> 00:16:51.060
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

00:16:51.316 --> 00:16:55.610
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.734
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:02.404
He'll not be going.

00:17:02.618 --> 00:17:05.951
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

00:17:06.121 --> 00:17:07.153
Muggle?

00:17:07.498 --> 00:17:11.495
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.578
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:21.717
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:26.722
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

00:17:26.935 --> 00:17:31.477
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

00:17:31.689 --> 00:17:33.729
...in front of me.

00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:56.868
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.211
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

00:18:02.511 --> 00:18:05.512
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

00:18:11.687 --> 00:18:14.890
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

00:18:29.203 --> 00:18:32.489
"All students must be equipped with...

00:18:32.706 --> 00:18:35.623
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

00:18:35.836 --> 00:18:41.624
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

00:18:41.883 --> 00:18:44.456
Can we find all this in London?

00:18:44.678 --> 00:18:47.051
If you know where to go.

00:19:09.827 --> 00:19:12.781
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

00:19:12.997 --> 00:19:16.864
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

00:19:17.084 --> 00:19:20.169
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

00:19:20.421 --> 00:19:23.956
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:31.713
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

00:19:31.932 --> 00:19:36.261
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

00:19:36.728 --> 00:19:41.971
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

00:19:42.192 --> 00:19:44.729
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

00:19:44.944 --> 00:19:49.938
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

00:19:50.158 --> 00:19:52.566
Oh, nice to meet you.

00:19:52.827 --> 00:19:55.912
Fearfully fascinating subject.

00:19:56.123 --> 00:20:00.749
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:05.833
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:07.792
Goodbye.

00:20:10.512 --> 00:20:14.094
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

00:20:14.307 --> 00:20:17.759
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

00:20:17.977 --> 00:20:21.761
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.539
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

00:20:58.892 --> 00:21:01.383
Here, you get your quills and ink.

00:21:01.646 --> 00:21:05.560
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

00:21:30.423 --> 00:21:32.664
It's a world-class racing broom.

00:21:32.883 --> 00:21:36.751
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

00:21:37.014 --> 00:21:40.299
It's the fastest model yet.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.598
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

00:21:48.817 --> 00:21:52.187
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

00:21:52.404 --> 00:21:57.909
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

00:22:10.546 --> 00:22:14.544
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.002
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:22.180
Best stay close.

00:22:26.229 --> 00:22:29.893
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

00:22:34.111 --> 00:22:37.278
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.443
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

00:22:44.288 --> 00:22:47.123
Ha! There's the little devil.

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:50.202
And there's something else as well.

00:22:51.462 --> 00:22:54.796
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:03.921
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

00:23:05.225 --> 00:23:07.182
Very well.

00:23:12.398 --> 00:23:15.233
Vault 687.

00:23:17.154 --> 00:23:19.442
Lamp, please.

00:23:27.957 --> 00:23:29.285
Key, please.

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:56.478
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

00:23:57.777 --> 00:24:01.477
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

00:24:01.698 --> 00:24:05.861
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

00:24:06.118 --> 00:24:07.661
Stand back.

00:24:35.939 --> 00:24:38.726
Best not to mention this to anyone.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.073
I still need a wand.

00:24:51.288 --> 00:24:54.704
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

00:24:55.417 --> 00:25:00.542
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

00:25:18.524 --> 00:25:20.351
Hello?

00:25:23.319 --> 00:25:25.146
Hello?

00:25:28.658 --> 00:25:32.952
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

00:25:40.753 --> 00:25:42.959
It seems only yesterday...

00:25:43.214 --> 00:25:49.050
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

00:25:55.726 --> 00:25:58.015
Here we are.

00:26:06.611 --> 00:26:09.149
Give it a wave.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.158
Apparently not.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.797
Perhaps...

00:26:29.468 --> 00:26:31.626
...this.

00:26:38.685 --> 00:26:43.312
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.155
I wonder...

00:27:21.351 --> 00:27:23.640
Curious.

00:27:23.854 --> 00:27:26.772
Very curious.

00:27:26.982 --> 00:27:30.102
Sorry, but what's curious?

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.106
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

00:27:35.324 --> 00:27:38.075
It so happens that the phoenix...

00:27:38.285 --> 00:27:42.995
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:46.499
Just one other.

00:27:46.712 --> 00:27:51.041
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

00:27:51.299 --> 00:27:56.969
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

00:27:58.806 --> 00:28:02.009
And who owned that wand?

00:28:02.852 --> 00:28:05.259
We do not speak his name.

00:28:05.729 --> 00:28:09.229
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

00:28:09.441 --> 00:28:12.442
It's not always clear why.

00:28:12.819 --> 00:28:16.318
But I think it is clear...

00:28:16.532 --> 00:28:20.447
...that we can expect
great things from you.

00:28:20.661 --> 00:28:24.907
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

00:28:25.166 --> 00:28:27.835
...did great things.

00:28:28.043 --> 00:28:30.036
Terrible...

00:28:30.503 --> 00:28:33.754
...yes, but great.

00:28:39.387 --> 00:28:41.427
Harry! Harry!

00:28:41.806 --> 00:28:44.178
Happy birthday.

00:28:51.316 --> 00:28:54.815
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

00:28:55.195 --> 00:29:00.781
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

00:29:00.992 --> 00:29:04.610
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

00:29:08.499 --> 00:29:13.042
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

00:29:13.253 --> 00:29:15.791
Not all wizards are good.

00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:18.497
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

00:29:18.718 --> 00:29:23.712
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V...

00:29:23.931 --> 00:29:27.550
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.643
No, I can't spell it.

00:29:29.854 --> 00:29:34.102
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

00:29:38.071 --> 00:29:40.313
It was dark times, Harry.

00:29:42.616 --> 00:29:45.736
<i>Voldemort started
to gather some followers.</i>

00:29:45.994 --> 00:29:49.328
<i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i>

00:29:50.707 --> 00:29:53.827
<i>Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.</i>

00:29:54.962 --> 00:29:57.998
<i>Your parents fought against him.</i>

00:29:58.215 --> 00:30:01.999
<i>But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.</i>

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.963
<i>Nobody, not one.</i>

00:30:09.184 --> 00:30:11.557
<i>Except you.</i>

00:30:13.563 --> 00:30:17.691
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

00:30:18.151 --> 00:30:22.315
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

00:30:22.613 --> 00:30:28.367
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

00:30:28.578 --> 00:30:32.196
What happened to V?
To You-Know-Who?

00:30:33.332 --> 00:30:36.701
Well, some say he died.

00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:39.326
Codswallop, in my opinion.

00:30:39.547 --> 00:30:42.798
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

00:30:43.009 --> 00:30:45.963
...too tired to carry on.

00:30:46.179 --> 00:30:51.599
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

00:30:51.852 --> 00:30:56.098
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

00:30:56.565 --> 00:31:00.230
You're the boy who lived.

00:31:09.576 --> 00:31:12.281
What are you looking at?

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:16.032
Blimey, is that the time?

00:31:16.251 --> 00:31:20.248
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

00:31:20.463 --> 00:31:25.338
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:30.889
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

00:31:33.767 --> 00:31:36.009
"Platform 93/4"?

00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:41.020
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 93/4.

00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:44.566
There's no such thing, is there?

00:32:03.088 --> 00:32:04.666
Sorry.

00:32:06.173 --> 00:32:08.926
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:32:09.135 --> 00:32:10.677
On your left.

00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:14.713
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 93/4?

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:17.470
Think you're being funny, do you?

00:32:17.685 --> 00:32:21.018
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:24.850
- Muggles?
- Platform 93/4, this way.

00:32:30.532 --> 00:32:33.698
All right, Percy, you first.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:44.867
Fred, you next.

00:32:45.087 --> 00:32:48.788
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

00:32:49.008 --> 00:32:50.965
I'm sorry, George.

00:32:55.097 --> 00:32:57.504
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

00:33:03.314 --> 00:33:05.887
Excuse me.

00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:09.771
Could you tell me how to?

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:13.522
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

00:33:13.741 --> 00:33:16.196
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:22.329
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.992
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:27.849
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

00:34:28.064 --> 00:34:30.270
Not at all.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.768
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:38.651
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

00:34:40.034 --> 00:34:42.073
So it's true!

00:34:42.285 --> 00:34:45.072
I mean, do you really have the?

00:34:45.664 --> 00:34:48.534
- The what?
- The scar?

00:34:51.712 --> 00:34:53.918
Wicked!

00:34:56.383 --> 00:35:01.543
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.889
We'll take the lot.

00:35:18.613 --> 00:35:23.405
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

00:35:23.827 --> 00:35:27.196
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

00:35:27.413 --> 00:35:31.245
...spinach, liver and tripe.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.623
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

00:35:40.302 --> 00:35:45.640
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

00:35:45.849 --> 00:35:51.305
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

00:35:52.814 --> 00:35:55.102
Watch it!

00:35:57.109 --> 00:36:00.893
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

00:36:03.782 --> 00:36:07.696
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

00:36:09.456 --> 00:36:10.997
Hey, he's gone!

00:36:11.207 --> 00:36:14.658
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

00:36:15.295 --> 00:36:18.413
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:19.793
A little.

00:36:20.007 --> 00:36:23.341
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

00:36:23.552 --> 00:36:25.591
Yeah.

00:36:32.352 --> 00:36:33.977
Has anyone seen a toad?

00:36:34.354 --> 00:36:37.023
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

00:36:37.608 --> 00:36:41.936
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

00:36:42.989 --> 00:36:47.318
<i>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</i>

00:36:47.576 --> 00:36:50.660
<i>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</i>

00:36:53.416 --> 00:36:59.038
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

00:36:59.254 --> 00:37:02.505
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

00:37:02.716 --> 00:37:05.337
...but they've all worked for me.

00:37:08.972 --> 00:37:11.012
For example:

00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:14.178
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

00:37:16.271 --> 00:37:18.892
That's better, isn't it?

00:37:20.066 --> 00:37:23.981
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

00:37:24.196 --> 00:37:27.778
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are?

00:37:28.492 --> 00:37:31.695
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

00:37:31.911 --> 00:37:36.988
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:44.580
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

00:37:44.799 --> 00:37:46.756
Just there.

00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:02.889
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:08.315
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

00:38:15.329 --> 00:38:18.282
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

00:38:19.374 --> 00:38:23.703
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

00:39:09.424 --> 00:39:11.216
Wicked.

00:39:39.369 --> 00:39:41.611
Welcome to Hogwarts.

00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:45.828
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

00:39:46.043 --> 00:39:51.084
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

00:39:51.299 --> 00:39:54.418
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

00:39:54.635 --> 00:39:59.096
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

00:39:59.515 --> 00:40:04.557
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

00:40:05.187 --> 00:40:08.686
Your triumphs will earn you points.

00:40:08.899 --> 00:40:13.027
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:18.527
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

00:40:18.784 --> 00:40:20.065
Trevor!

00:40:29.002 --> 00:40:30.627
Sorry.

00:40:30.837 --> 00:40:34.787
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

00:40:36.135 --> 00:40:39.468
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

00:40:39.888 --> 00:40:42.509
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

00:40:42.724 --> 00:40:44.134
Harry Potter?

00:40:44.767 --> 00:40:47.437
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:49.934
And I'm Malfoy.

00:40:50.273 --> 00:40:52.598
Draco Malfoy.

00:40:54.569 --> 00:40:58.152
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

00:40:58.364 --> 00:41:04.154
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

00:41:05.079 --> 00:41:09.123
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:13.117
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:15.495
I can help you there.

00:41:17.716 --> 00:41:21.548
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

00:41:27.185 --> 00:41:29.391
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

00:41:47.997 --> 00:41:52.493
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

00:41:52.835 --> 00:41:55.705
<i>I read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.</i>

00:42:08.976 --> 00:42:11.811
Will you wait along here, please?

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:16.017
Now, before we begin...

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:19.482
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

00:42:19.695 --> 00:42:24.486
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

00:42:24.865 --> 00:42:26.989
The first years, please note...

00:42:27.285 --> 00:42:33.288
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

00:42:33.541 --> 00:42:39.045
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

00:42:39.254 --> 00:42:43.881
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

00:42:44.176 --> 00:42:48.389
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

00:42:49.766 --> 00:42:51.722
Thank you.

00:42:53.478 --> 00:42:57.558
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

00:42:57.773 --> 00:43:01.392
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:04.814
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

00:43:05.031 --> 00:43:07.652
Hermione Granger.

00:43:09.911 --> 00:43:12.531
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

00:43:12.914 --> 00:43:16.282
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

00:43:21.756 --> 00:43:25.624
Right, then. Right.

00:43:25.843 --> 00:43:29.426
Okay. Gryffindor!

00:43:38.229 --> 00:43:41.017
Draco Malfoy.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:47.776
Slytherin!

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.657
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

00:43:51.868 --> 00:43:54.406
Susan Bones.

00:44:02.963 --> 00:44:05.086
Harry, what is it?

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.044
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

00:44:08.301 --> 00:44:09.711
Let's see...

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:14.299
I know! Hufflepuff!

00:44:16.058 --> 00:44:18.465
Ronald Weasley.

00:44:32.326 --> 00:44:37.320
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.328
Gryffindor!

00:44:46.547 --> 00:44:49.039
Harry Potter.

00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:10.109
Difficult, very difficult.

00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:14.270
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

00:45:14.492 --> 00:45:16.780
There's talent, oh, yes.

00:45:16.994 --> 00:45:20.826
And a thirst to prove yourself.

00:45:21.039 --> 00:45:23.198
But where to put you?

00:45:23.792 --> 00:45:26.282
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

00:45:26.545 --> 00:45:30.163
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

00:45:30.382 --> 00:45:35.257
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:40.808
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

00:45:41.142 --> 00:45:45.768
No? Well, if you're sure.

00:45:45.981 --> 00:45:47.724
Better be...

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.898
...Gryffindor!

00:46:15.426 --> 00:46:18.213
Your attention, please.

00:46:20.265 --> 00:46:22.970
Let the feast begin.

00:46:39.909 --> 00:46:41.451
I'm half and half.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.910
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

00:46:45.122 --> 00:46:48.621
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

00:46:49.626 --> 00:46:53.410
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

00:46:53.755 --> 00:46:56.874
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

00:46:57.092 --> 00:46:59.002
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:04.806
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

00:47:09.312 --> 00:47:11.637
Hello! How are you?

00:47:11.898 --> 00:47:15.267
Welcome to Gryffindor.

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:27.861
It's the Bloody Baron!

00:47:32.503 --> 00:47:35.290
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

00:47:35.506 --> 00:47:40.926
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

00:47:43.972 --> 00:47:46.889
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.852
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

00:47:50.061 --> 00:47:53.561
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

00:47:53.898 --> 00:47:55.855
Like this.

00:48:05.868 --> 00:48:09.700
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

00:48:09.914 --> 00:48:14.243
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:17.835
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

00:48:18.047 --> 00:48:22.210
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

00:48:31.351 --> 00:48:37.139
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

00:48:37.357 --> 00:48:40.026
That picture's moving.

00:48:40.235 --> 00:48:43.734
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

00:48:45.491 --> 00:48:47.816
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

00:48:48.034 --> 00:48:50.572
Welcome to Hogwarts.

00:49:06.595 --> 00:49:08.172
Password?

00:49:08.638 --> 00:49:11.426
Caput Draconis.

00:49:18.189 --> 00:49:23.065
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

00:49:25.781 --> 00:49:28.188
Gather around here.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.194
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

00:49:33.413 --> 00:49:37.825
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

00:49:38.042 --> 00:49:41.162
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

00:50:49.363 --> 00:50:50.987
Made it!

00:50:51.198 --> 00:50:55.610
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

00:50:58.872 --> 00:51:03.829
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

00:51:04.043 --> 00:51:08.337
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

00:51:08.547 --> 00:51:11.751
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:17.722
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

00:51:25.898 --> 00:51:31.568
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

00:51:31.779 --> 00:51:35.397
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

00:51:35.658 --> 00:51:39.358
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

00:51:39.578 --> 00:51:42.662
However, for those select few...

00:51:43.581 --> 00:51:46.915
...who possess the predisposition...

00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:53.875
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

00:51:54.093 --> 00:51:57.010
...and ensnare the senses.

00:51:57.221 --> 00:51:59.760
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

00:51:59.974 --> 00:52:05.893
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

00:52:09.942 --> 00:52:14.817
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

00:52:15.029 --> 00:52:20.984
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

00:52:21.202 --> 00:52:24.156
...to not pay attention.

00:52:30.128 --> 00:52:32.702
Mr. Potter.

00:52:33.924 --> 00:52:37.756
Our new celebrity.

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:45.718
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.387
You don't know? Let's try again.

00:52:51.607 --> 00:52:56.233
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:58.905
I don't know, sir.

00:52:59.199 --> 00:53:03.030
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:07.821
I don't know, sir.

00:53:08.916 --> 00:53:10.196
Pity.

00:53:11.919 --> 00:53:16.130
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

00:53:16.882 --> 00:53:19.669
...is it, Mr. Potter?

00:53:21.845 --> 00:53:27.468
<i>Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum</i>

00:53:28.686 --> 00:53:30.227
<i>Eye of rabbit...</i>

00:53:30.562 --> 00:53:33.231
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

00:53:33.482 --> 00:53:38.191
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

00:53:44.911 --> 00:53:46.819
Mail's here.

00:54:19.111 --> 00:54:22.064
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

00:54:25.992 --> 00:54:28.198
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:33.915
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:37.625
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:41.335
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

00:54:41.548 --> 00:54:45.213
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

00:54:45.469 --> 00:54:51.174
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

00:54:51.392 --> 00:54:57.097
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

00:54:57.315 --> 00:55:01.562
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

00:55:10.495 --> 00:55:14.242
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

00:55:14.456 --> 00:55:17.243
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

00:55:18.544 --> 00:55:20.999
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

00:55:21.213 --> 00:55:25.127
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

00:55:25.342 --> 00:55:30.930
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.096
Up!

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:34.299
Up.

00:55:35.811 --> 00:55:37.638
Up.

00:55:39.314 --> 00:55:40.939
Up. Up!

00:55:41.149 --> 00:55:43.141
With feeling.

00:55:51.826 --> 00:55:53.949
Shut up, Harry.

00:55:54.203 --> 00:55:58.830
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

00:55:59.041 --> 00:56:03.039
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

00:56:03.421 --> 00:56:08.379
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

00:56:08.593 --> 00:56:12.425
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

00:56:12.638 --> 00:56:16.932
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

00:56:17.184 --> 00:56:20.304
On my whistle. Three, two...

00:56:22.731 --> 00:56:24.106
Mr. Longbottom.

00:56:28.738 --> 00:56:31.608
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

00:56:31.824 --> 00:56:33.069
Neville!

00:56:36.788 --> 00:56:39.458
Come back down this instant!

00:57:08.443 --> 00:57:10.815
Everyone out of the way!

00:57:16.369 --> 00:57:18.527
Is he all right?

00:57:18.913 --> 00:57:24.583
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

00:57:25.877 --> 00:57:30.539
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

00:57:30.756 --> 00:57:34.421
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

00:57:34.635 --> 00:57:39.878
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

00:57:40.099 --> 00:57:42.009
Did you see his face?

00:57:42.226 --> 00:57:46.058
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

00:57:46.272 --> 00:57:48.763
Give it here, Malfoy.

00:57:49.609 --> 00:57:53.309
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

00:57:57.493 --> 00:57:59.947
How about on the roof?

00:58:01.121 --> 00:58:04.952
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:11.292
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

00:58:11.506 --> 00:58:14.424
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

00:58:14.717 --> 00:58:16.626
What an idiot.

00:58:19.973 --> 00:58:23.507
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

00:58:23.726 --> 00:58:25.849
Is that so?

00:58:28.981 --> 00:58:31.270
Have it your way, then.

00:59:04.016 --> 00:59:07.634
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

00:59:07.853 --> 00:59:09.892
Harry Potter!

00:59:10.856 --> 00:59:12.848
Follow me.

00:59:24.535 --> 00:59:26.777
You wait here.

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:33.831
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

00:59:34.045 --> 00:59:35.872
Yes, of course.

00:59:41.554 --> 00:59:47.307
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

00:59:49.394 --> 00:59:52.893
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

00:59:53.148 --> 00:59:55.354
I always knew he'd do well.

00:59:55.817 --> 00:59:59.861
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

01:00:00.071 --> 01:00:04.567
- You must be the youngest player in...
- A century, McGonagall says.

01:00:04.783 --> 01:00:07.405
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.110
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:14.030
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

01:00:14.251 --> 01:00:16.921
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:21.079
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:24.052
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

01:00:24.303 --> 01:00:29.926
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

01:00:30.142 --> 01:00:33.344
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:38.562
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

01:00:47.116 --> 01:00:50.948
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

01:00:51.788 --> 01:00:53.994
I didn't know.

01:00:58.504 --> 01:01:03.083
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:05.588
Who doesn't?

01:01:06.512 --> 01:01:08.635
What's happening?

01:01:08.847 --> 01:01:13.058
The staircases change, remember?

01:01:18.522 --> 01:01:22.983
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

01:01:30.618 --> 01:01:34.034
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

01:01:34.288 --> 01:01:36.412
We're not supposed to be here.

01:01:36.624 --> 01:01:40.539
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

01:01:41.713 --> 01:01:43.290
Let's go.

01:01:45.508 --> 01:01:48.378
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

01:01:52.181 --> 01:01:55.514
Quick, let's hide through that door!

01:02:00.647 --> 01:02:02.687
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.059
Move over!

01:02:06.028 --> 01:02:08.151
<i>Alohomora.</i>

01:02:09.031 --> 01:02:10.940
Get in.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.280
<i>Alohomora?</i>

01:02:13.494 --> 01:02:16.031
<i>Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.</i>

01:02:16.246 --> 01:02:19.615
Anyone here, my sweet?

01:02:25.881 --> 01:02:26.876
Come on.

01:02:27.757 --> 01:02:30.213
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

01:02:30.469 --> 01:02:34.087
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:05.245
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

01:03:05.461 --> 01:03:09.126
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:13.504
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.590
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

01:03:16.806 --> 01:03:20.471
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

01:03:20.685 --> 01:03:24.219
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

01:03:24.647 --> 01:03:28.395
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

01:03:28.609 --> 01:03:32.227
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

01:03:32.446 --> 01:03:35.566
Or worse, expelled.

01:03:38.827 --> 01:03:43.074
She needs to sort out her priorities.

01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:51.921
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

01:03:52.133 --> 01:03:57.838
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

01:04:02.935 --> 01:04:07.063
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

01:04:07.273 --> 01:04:13.227
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

01:04:13.445 --> 01:04:17.823
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

01:04:18.033 --> 01:04:22.493
I think so. What are those?

01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:26.947
You better take this.

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:39.797
Careful now, it's coming back.

01:04:46.394 --> 01:04:50.012
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

01:05:06.665 --> 01:05:08.952
What was that?

01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:13.457
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:17.170
But you are a Seeker.

01:05:20.761 --> 01:05:25.339
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

01:05:25.598 --> 01:05:28.089
The Golden Snitch.

01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:31.310
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

01:05:31.522 --> 01:05:35.520
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

01:05:35.734 --> 01:05:37.691
What do I do with it?

01:05:37.903 --> 01:05:41.153
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

01:05:41.408 --> 01:05:43.862
You catch this, the game's over.

01:05:44.076 --> 01:05:48.026
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

01:05:57.089 --> 01:06:02.427
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

01:06:02.636 --> 01:06:06.585
...or the ability to make objects fly.

01:06:06.806 --> 01:06:09.213
Do you have your feathers? Good.

01:06:09.476 --> 01:06:14.600
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

01:06:14.815 --> 01:06:18.148
The swish and flick. Everyone.

01:06:18.694 --> 01:06:24.316
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

01:06:25.032 --> 01:06:29.326
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.</i>

01:06:30.371 --> 01:06:32.862
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

01:06:33.124 --> 01:06:35.449
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:43.543
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:49.755
<i>Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.</i>

01:06:50.348 --> 01:06:54.559
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

01:06:55.813 --> 01:06:58.897
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

01:07:06.407 --> 01:07:12.031
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

01:07:12.246 --> 01:07:13.906
Splendid!

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:17.705
Well done, dear.

01:07:21.921 --> 01:07:26.002
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:36.763
<i>"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."</i>

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:42.359
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

01:07:43.026 --> 01:07:45.564
I think she heard you.

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:16.300
Where's Hermione?

01:08:16.518 --> 01:08:19.636
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

01:08:19.854 --> 01:08:23.934
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

01:08:28.361 --> 01:08:32.026
Troll in the dungeon!

01:08:32.284 --> 01:08:35.616
Troll in the dungeon!

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:40.739
Thought you ought to know.

01:08:47.632 --> 01:08:50.467
Silence!

01:08:52.052 --> 01:08:56.097
Everyone will please not panic!

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:58.343
Now...

01:08:58.559 --> 01:09:03.101
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

01:09:03.813 --> 01:09:08.606
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

01:09:19.663 --> 01:09:22.830
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:24.785
How could a troll get in?

01:09:25.002 --> 01:09:30.162
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

01:09:30.382 --> 01:09:34.380
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

01:09:46.481 --> 01:09:49.730
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

01:09:53.613 --> 01:09:55.771
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

01:10:26.812 --> 01:10:29.184
Hermione, move!

01:10:32.568 --> 01:10:36.696
Help! Help!

01:10:38.699 --> 01:10:40.775
Hey, pea brain!

01:10:53.213 --> 01:10:55.086
Help!

01:11:16.235 --> 01:11:18.608
Do something!

01:11:20.031 --> 01:11:23.981
- What?
- Anything!

01:11:24.618 --> 01:11:27.026
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

01:11:27.246 --> 01:11:29.571
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

01:11:40.511 --> 01:11:42.503
Cool.

01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:09.745
Is it dead?

01:12:09.955 --> 01:12:13.869
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

01:12:20.132 --> 01:12:22.457
Troll boogers.

01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:28.505
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

01:12:28.724 --> 01:12:33.350
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

01:12:35.522 --> 01:12:36.720
Miss Granger?

01:12:37.607 --> 01:12:42.684
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

01:12:42.904 --> 01:12:44.778
But I was wrong.

01:12:44.989 --> 01:12:50.030
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

01:12:51.036 --> 01:12:55.449
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

01:12:55.667 --> 01:13:01.337
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

01:13:01.548 --> 01:13:04.549
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.342
...for your serious lack of judgment.

01:13:08.805 --> 01:13:10.798
As for you two gentlemen...

01:13:11.016 --> 01:13:14.432
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

01:13:14.644 --> 01:13:18.060
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

01:13:18.272 --> 01:13:20.894
...and live to tell the tale.

01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:23.558
Five points...

01:13:24.945 --> 01:13:28.065
...will be awarded to each of you...

01:13:29.659 --> 01:13:32.744
...for sheer dumb luck.

01:13:38.334 --> 01:13:42.082
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

01:13:49.956 --> 01:13:52.708
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

01:13:52.918 --> 01:13:56.120
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

01:13:56.338 --> 01:13:58.544
I'm not hungry.

01:13:59.132 --> 01:14:04.755
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

01:14:04.971 --> 01:14:08.138
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:11.470
Even if it is against Slytherin.

01:14:19.152 --> 01:14:22.568
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

01:14:22.989 --> 01:14:27.117
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

01:14:27.326 --> 01:14:29.996
...so he could get past that dog.

01:14:30.204 --> 01:14:32.956
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

01:14:33.208 --> 01:14:35.414
But why would anyone go near that dog?

01:14:36.085 --> 01:14:39.336
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

01:14:39.547 --> 01:14:42.797
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:44.124
You're saying...

01:14:44.345 --> 01:14:48.840
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

01:15:01.987 --> 01:15:05.935
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:08.033
Let's open it.

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:19.456
It's a broomstick.

01:15:20.254 --> 01:15:24.382
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

01:15:25.843 --> 01:15:27.882
But who?

01:15:49.532 --> 01:15:52.023
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:55.908
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

01:15:56.122 --> 01:15:59.622
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

01:15:59.918 --> 01:16:02.587
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

01:16:02.796 --> 01:16:05.631
Woke up in hospital a week later.

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:31.189
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

01:16:31.408 --> 01:16:36.117
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

01:17:06.401 --> 01:17:08.856
The players take their positions...

01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:12.854
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

01:17:13.074 --> 01:17:16.407
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

01:17:17.035 --> 01:17:19.443
...from all of you!

01:17:24.584 --> 01:17:27.502
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

01:17:27.712 --> 01:17:30.417
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

01:17:30.631 --> 01:17:34.415
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

01:17:40.558 --> 01:17:44.687
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

01:18:03.373 --> 01:18:08.165
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

01:18:13.341 --> 01:18:14.621
Well done!

01:18:19.013 --> 01:18:24.719
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

01:18:56.758 --> 01:18:59.546
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

01:19:13.358 --> 01:19:15.232
Give me that!

01:19:46.683 --> 01:19:49.305
Take that side!

01:20:38.776 --> 01:20:42.026
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

01:20:50.955 --> 01:20:53.161
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

01:20:53.374 --> 01:20:57.751
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

01:21:19.524 --> 01:21:21.066
Come on, Hermione!

01:21:35.164 --> 01:21:38.913
<i>Lacarnum Inflamarae.</i>

01:21:46.008 --> 01:21:49.044
Fire! You're on fire!

01:22:06.904 --> 01:22:09.063
Go, go, go, go!

01:23:01.082 --> 01:23:03.407
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

01:23:04.501 --> 01:23:05.960
He's got the Snitch!

01:23:06.170 --> 01:23:10.250
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

01:23:10.467 --> 01:23:12.127
Gryffindor wins!

01:23:55.719 --> 01:23:59.967
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

01:24:00.182 --> 01:24:04.096
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

01:24:04.312 --> 01:24:06.718
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

01:24:06.938 --> 01:24:10.603
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

01:24:10.817 --> 01:24:16.108
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard...

01:24:16.322 --> 01:24:20.901
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

01:24:21.495 --> 01:24:25.493
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

01:24:25.707 --> 01:24:29.159
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:34.746
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

01:24:34.966 --> 01:24:38.549
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

01:24:38.762 --> 01:24:41.003
Exactly.

01:24:41.681 --> 01:24:44.433
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

01:24:44.642 --> 01:24:49.304
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

01:24:49.522 --> 01:24:54.598
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

01:24:54.819 --> 01:24:56.229
Nicholas Flamel?

01:24:57.238 --> 01:25:01.947
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:06.240
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

01:25:06.456 --> 01:25:08.449
I don't know.

01:25:27.309 --> 01:25:30.144
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

01:25:30.395 --> 01:25:33.182
<i>Ring the Hogwart bell</i>

01:25:33.399 --> 01:25:36.186
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

01:25:36.402 --> 01:25:39.320
<i>Cast a Christmas spell</i>

01:25:52.918 --> 01:25:56.252
Knight to e5.

01:26:03.928 --> 01:26:06.086
Queen to e5.

01:26:11.729 --> 01:26:13.139
That's totally barbaric!

01:26:13.772 --> 01:26:17.306
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

01:26:17.525 --> 01:26:18.984
I see you haven't.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:24.485
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

01:26:24.699 --> 01:26:28.531
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

01:26:28.744 --> 01:26:32.113
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

01:26:32.331 --> 01:26:35.830
We've looked a hundred times!

01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:41.703
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

01:26:43.927 --> 01:26:46.844
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

01:26:49.391 --> 01:26:53.720
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

01:27:03.571 --> 01:27:06.905
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

01:27:07.116 --> 01:27:09.322
What are you wearing?

01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:13.611
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

01:27:14.748 --> 01:27:17.156
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

01:27:24.592 --> 01:27:26.667
There they are.

01:27:37.688 --> 01:27:41.187
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

01:27:41.441 --> 01:27:45.569
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

01:28:02.379 --> 01:28:06.079
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

01:28:06.383 --> 01:28:09.299
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

01:28:14.725 --> 01:28:16.004
My body's gone!

01:28:16.226 --> 01:28:19.809
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

01:28:20.355 --> 01:28:22.264
I'm invisible?

01:28:22.732 --> 01:28:27.145
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

01:28:27.611 --> 01:28:32.404
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

01:29:00.477 --> 01:29:06.349
<i>Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.</i>

01:29:06.566 --> 01:29:12.402
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

01:29:31.215 --> 01:29:33.125
Who's there?

01:29:39.266 --> 01:29:44.889
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

01:29:52.279 --> 01:29:56.027
Who is it? Show yourself.

01:30:43.203 --> 01:30:44.578
Severus, I...

01:30:45.247 --> 01:30:49.114
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

01:30:49.334 --> 01:30:54.043
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

01:31:11.273 --> 01:31:14.477
We'll have another little chat soon.

01:31:14.694 --> 01:31:20.149
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

01:31:20.407 --> 01:31:24.819
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:30.411
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

01:33:02.507 --> 01:33:04.334
Mum?

01:33:07.595 --> 01:33:09.588
Dad?

01:33:44.339 --> 01:33:49.298
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

01:33:51.138 --> 01:33:54.008
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

01:33:54.224 --> 01:33:57.807
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

01:34:04.527 --> 01:34:08.820
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

01:34:10.283 --> 01:34:12.240
I only see us.

01:34:12.493 --> 01:34:15.827
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

01:34:16.038 --> 01:34:21.957
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

01:34:22.461 --> 01:34:24.786
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

01:34:25.047 --> 01:34:29.210
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

01:34:30.343 --> 01:34:32.799
I look good.

01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:37.262
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

01:34:37.476 --> 01:34:42.434
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

01:35:05.586 --> 01:35:07.744
Back again, Harry?

01:35:10.842 --> 01:35:13.332
I see that you,
like many before you...

01:35:13.553 --> 01:35:17.717
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

01:35:18.058 --> 01:35:22.221
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

01:35:23.521 --> 01:35:26.058
Let me give you a clue.

01:35:26.608 --> 01:35:28.730
The happiest man on earth...

01:35:28.942 --> 01:35:32.312
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

01:35:32.529 --> 01:35:34.854
...exactly as he is.

01:35:35.073 --> 01:35:40.114
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

01:35:40.329 --> 01:35:43.081
Yes. And no.

01:35:44.125 --> 01:35:46.580
It shows us nothing more or less...

01:35:46.794 --> 01:35:52.749
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

01:35:52.968 --> 01:35:57.676
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

01:35:57.889 --> 01:36:01.756
...you see them standing beside you.

01:36:01.976 --> 01:36:04.383
But remember this, Harry.

01:36:04.645 --> 01:36:10.517
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

01:36:10.734 --> 01:36:12.857
...or truth.

01:36:13.821 --> 01:36:19.858
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:25.039
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

01:36:25.249 --> 01:36:27.158
And I must ask you...

01:36:28.126 --> 01:36:31.993
...not to go looking for it again.

01:36:32.756 --> 01:36:35.875
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

01:36:36.468 --> 01:36:39.338
...and forget to live.

01:37:34.066 --> 01:37:39.736
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

01:37:39.989 --> 01:37:43.074
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

01:37:43.284 --> 01:37:45.276
This is light?

01:37:49.873 --> 01:37:52.281
Of course! Here it is!

01:37:52.501 --> 01:37:56.499
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

01:37:56.755 --> 01:37:57.917
The what?

01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:01.591
Honestly, don't you two read?

01:38:01.801 --> 01:38:06.297
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

01:38:06.514 --> 01:38:09.135
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:13.348
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

01:38:13.562 --> 01:38:15.720
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:18.017
I know what it means!

01:38:18.902 --> 01:38:23.610
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

01:38:23.823 --> 01:38:28.983
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

01:38:30.704 --> 01:38:32.862
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

01:38:33.082 --> 01:38:37.791
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

01:38:54.562 --> 01:38:58.346
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

01:38:58.566 --> 01:39:01.271
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

01:39:05.991 --> 01:39:11.114
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

01:39:11.328 --> 01:39:14.115
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

01:39:14.498 --> 01:39:18.661
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:19.998
What?

01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:23.585
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

01:39:23.799 --> 01:39:26.468
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

01:39:26.677 --> 01:39:30.544
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:33.386
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

01:39:33.642 --> 01:39:36.679
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

01:39:36.896 --> 01:39:38.971
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:42.854
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:46.692
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

01:40:00.543 --> 01:40:05.619
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

01:40:05.882 --> 01:40:07.874
I know what that is!

01:40:08.093 --> 01:40:10.713
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

01:40:11.095 --> 01:40:14.345
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

01:40:14.558 --> 01:40:18.638
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

01:40:40.876 --> 01:40:43.082
Is that...

01:40:43.878 --> 01:40:45.041
...a dragon?

01:40:45.255 --> 01:40:49.667
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

01:40:49.884 --> 01:40:52.755
My brother works
with these in Romania.

01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:57.846
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

01:40:58.517 --> 01:41:00.261
Hello, Norbert.

01:41:00.602 --> 01:41:04.896
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

01:41:05.648 --> 01:41:08.104
Don't you, Norbert?

01:41:15.076 --> 01:41:18.195
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

01:41:22.082 --> 01:41:24.158
Who's that?

01:41:25.877 --> 01:41:27.954
Malfoy.

01:41:28.713 --> 01:41:30.123
Oh, dear.

01:41:31.841 --> 01:41:36.633
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

01:41:36.846 --> 01:41:40.890
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:45.180
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.639
Good evening.

01:41:51.278 --> 01:41:54.196
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

01:41:54.448 --> 01:41:57.947
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

01:41:58.159 --> 01:42:03.035
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

01:42:03.248 --> 01:42:05.573
- 50?!
- Each.

01:42:06.626 --> 01:42:08.998
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

01:42:09.212 --> 01:42:12.545
...all four of you
will receive detention.

01:42:13.465 --> 01:42:16.419
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

01:42:16.635 --> 01:42:18.960
I thought you said the four of us.

01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:21.671
No, you heard me correctly.

01:42:21.891 --> 01:42:26.885
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

01:42:27.355 --> 01:42:30.309
You will join your classmates
in detention.

01:42:41.535 --> 01:42:45.533
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

01:42:45.748 --> 01:42:50.456
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

01:42:50.669 --> 01:42:53.504
God, I miss the screaming.

01:42:56.049 --> 01:42:59.334
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

01:42:59.552 --> 01:43:04.891
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

01:43:06.976 --> 01:43:09.931
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

01:43:11.398 --> 01:43:16.392
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

01:43:18.656 --> 01:43:20.731
Norbert's gone.

01:43:21.283 --> 01:43:24.818
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:28.370
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:30.865
What if he don't like Romania?

01:43:31.084 --> 01:43:35.330
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

01:43:35.964 --> 01:43:41.206
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

01:43:41.428 --> 01:43:43.800
Got to have your wits about you.

01:43:44.014 --> 01:43:49.684
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

01:43:50.144 --> 01:43:53.976
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

01:43:55.525 --> 01:43:56.769
...werewolves.

01:43:57.192 --> 01:44:00.478
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

01:44:00.696 --> 01:44:03.365
You can be sure of that.

01:44:05.326 --> 01:44:06.736
Nighty-night.

01:44:09.330 --> 01:44:12.165
Right. Let's go.

01:44:50.370 --> 01:44:52.778
Hagrid, what is that?

01:44:52.999 --> 01:44:56.367
What we're here for.
See that?

01:44:56.877 --> 01:45:02.251
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

01:45:02.799 --> 01:45:07.378
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

01:45:14.894 --> 01:45:20.648
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

01:45:20.858 --> 01:45:23.978
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

01:45:24.445 --> 01:45:27.730
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

01:45:28.992 --> 01:45:31.280
Okay. Then I get Fang.

01:45:31.453 --> 01:45:37.206
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

01:45:40.878 --> 01:45:45.872
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

01:45:46.091 --> 01:45:50.006
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

01:45:50.221 --> 01:45:52.793
I'm not scared, Potter.

01:45:53.932 --> 01:45:55.890
Do you hear that?

01:45:58.437 --> 01:45:59.847
Come on, Fang.

01:46:00.062 --> 01:46:01.558
Scared!

01:46:26.548 --> 01:46:28.706
What is it, Fang?

01:47:39.077 --> 01:47:44.581
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:48.789
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

01:47:49.005 --> 01:47:51.756
What was that thing you saved me from?

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:57.304
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

01:47:57.513 --> 01:48:03.053
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

01:48:03.268 --> 01:48:08.345
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

01:48:08.565 --> 01:48:13.393
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

01:48:13.612 --> 01:48:15.403
A cursed life.

01:48:15.614 --> 01:48:19.563
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

01:48:19.784 --> 01:48:24.743
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

01:48:25.081 --> 01:48:28.995
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

01:48:29.211 --> 01:48:34.371
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

01:48:35.217 --> 01:48:36.759
The Philosopher's Stone.

01:48:38.094 --> 01:48:40.087
Harry!

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:45.176
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

01:48:45.392 --> 01:48:47.552
You all right there, Harry?

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:52.982
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

01:48:53.859 --> 01:48:57.691
You're safe now. Good luck.

01:49:05.328 --> 01:49:09.456
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

01:49:09.667 --> 01:49:12.454
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

01:49:12.670 --> 01:49:15.587
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:20.176
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

01:49:20.386 --> 01:49:24.929
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

01:49:25.141 --> 01:49:26.718
He'll come back.

01:49:26.934 --> 01:49:28.678
But if he comes back...

01:49:28.936 --> 01:49:32.886
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

01:49:33.899 --> 01:49:37.434
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

01:49:37.653 --> 01:49:41.235
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

01:49:41.447 --> 01:49:45.031
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

01:49:45.411 --> 01:49:50.286
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

01:49:51.042 --> 01:49:56.166
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

01:49:56.379 --> 01:50:00.424
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

01:50:06.181 --> 01:50:11.601
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

01:50:11.811 --> 01:50:15.476
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

01:50:15.689 --> 01:50:20.849
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:23.739
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

01:50:23.949 --> 01:50:27.448
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

01:50:35.084 --> 01:50:37.540
- Of course!
- What is it?

01:50:37.753 --> 01:50:41.501
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

01:50:41.715 --> 01:50:44.799
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

01:50:45.011 --> 01:50:47.680
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

01:50:47.888 --> 01:50:50.131
Why didn't I see it before?

01:50:55.730 --> 01:50:59.230
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

01:50:59.442 --> 01:51:02.194
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

01:51:02.404 --> 01:51:04.976
You and this stranger
must have talked.

01:51:05.573 --> 01:51:09.108
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

01:51:09.327 --> 01:51:13.324
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

01:51:13.539 --> 01:51:18.000
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

01:51:18.418 --> 01:51:22.582
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

01:51:22.797 --> 01:51:28.421
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

01:51:28.636 --> 01:51:34.093
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

01:51:35.727 --> 01:51:38.433
I shouldn't have told you that.

01:51:38.689 --> 01:51:40.895
Where are you going?

01:51:47.906 --> 01:51:50.657
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

01:51:51.117 --> 01:51:53.739
I'm afraid he's not here.

01:51:53.953 --> 01:51:58.246
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

01:51:58.666 --> 01:52:01.203
He's gone?
But this is important!

01:52:01.461 --> 01:52:03.667
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:09.289
- How do you know?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

01:52:09.928 --> 01:52:15.134
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

01:52:15.349 --> 01:52:19.643
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

01:52:27.945 --> 01:52:30.732
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

01:52:30.948 --> 01:52:33.617
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

01:52:33.826 --> 01:52:37.694
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

01:52:39.749 --> 01:52:42.832
What would three young Gryffindors...

01:52:43.086 --> 01:52:47.379
...be doing inside on a day like this?

01:52:52.136 --> 01:52:55.671
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

01:52:56.223 --> 01:52:58.181
People will think you're...

01:53:02.479 --> 01:53:05.183
...up to something.

01:53:15.492 --> 01:53:17.484
Now what do we do?

01:53:17.702 --> 01:53:21.450
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

01:53:35.219 --> 01:53:36.678
Trevor.

01:53:37.013 --> 01:53:40.428
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

01:53:40.683 --> 01:53:46.104
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

01:53:46.314 --> 01:53:50.264
- Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

01:53:50.526 --> 01:53:55.105
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

01:53:55.324 --> 01:53:59.618
<i>Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.</i>

01:54:07.585 --> 01:54:11.369
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

01:54:11.631 --> 01:54:15.249
Brilliant, but scary.

01:54:15.927 --> 01:54:17.966
Let's go.

01:54:18.179 --> 01:54:22.426
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

01:54:27.855 --> 01:54:31.805
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

01:54:35.696 --> 01:54:37.736
<i>Alohomora.</i>

01:54:49.751 --> 01:54:52.325
Wait a minute. He's...

01:54:53.547 --> 01:54:55.705
...snoring.

01:54:58.218 --> 01:55:03.757
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

01:55:05.349 --> 01:55:08.350
It's got horrible breath.

01:55:10.938 --> 01:55:13.015
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

01:55:13.233 --> 01:55:14.644
Come on!

01:55:18.698 --> 01:55:20.773
Okay. Push.

01:55:43.930 --> 01:55:47.549
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

01:55:47.768 --> 01:55:52.762
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

01:55:53.564 --> 01:55:57.016
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

01:55:57.735 --> 01:55:59.562
The harp.

01:56:00.237 --> 01:56:02.942
It's stopped playing.

01:56:12.999 --> 01:56:14.114
Jump!

01:56:28.306 --> 01:56:31.925
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

01:56:46.365 --> 01:56:49.449
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

01:56:49.662 --> 01:56:53.362
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

01:56:53.582 --> 01:56:58.576
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

01:57:00.839 --> 01:57:02.168
Hermione!

01:57:02.758 --> 01:57:06.541
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

01:57:06.761 --> 01:57:11.257
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

01:57:18.356 --> 01:57:21.689
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:24.937
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

01:57:25.154 --> 01:57:27.692
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

01:57:27.906 --> 01:57:30.824
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

01:57:31.702 --> 01:57:35.534
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

01:57:35.748 --> 01:57:40.125
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

01:57:40.378 --> 01:57:42.417
<i>Lumus Solem.</i>

01:57:50.512 --> 01:57:53.086
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

01:57:55.809 --> 01:57:58.264
Lucky we didn't panic.

01:57:59.021 --> 01:58:02.520
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

01:58:04.150 --> 01:58:05.644
What is that?

01:58:05.861 --> 01:58:09.561
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

01:58:22.712 --> 01:58:26.163
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

01:58:26.382 --> 01:58:30.000
They're not birds.
They're keys.

01:58:30.219 --> 01:58:33.669
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

01:58:37.142 --> 01:58:41.768
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

01:58:47.653 --> 01:58:49.692
Strange.

01:58:50.113 --> 01:58:52.402
<i>Alohomora!</i>

01:58:55.369 --> 01:58:57.610
Well, it was worth a try.

01:58:57.829 --> 01:59:01.079
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

01:59:01.291 --> 01:59:05.204
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

01:59:05.419 --> 01:59:08.835
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

01:59:12.426 --> 01:59:14.751
What's wrong?

01:59:15.637 --> 01:59:17.131
It's too simple.

01:59:17.347 --> 01:59:22.093
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

01:59:22.311 --> 01:59:25.846
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

01:59:42.706 --> 01:59:45.706
This complicates things a bit.

02:00:06.981 --> 02:00:08.890
Catch the key!

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:15.230
Hurry up!

02:00:47.729 --> 02:00:52.390
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

02:00:52.608 --> 02:00:55.775
Where are we? A graveyard.

02:00:56.153 --> 02:00:58.774
This is no graveyard.

02:01:06.287 --> 02:01:09.205
It's a chessboard.

02:01:21.179 --> 02:01:23.088
There's the door.

02:01:35.150 --> 02:01:36.645
Now what do we do?

02:01:37.027 --> 02:01:41.155
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:45.488
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

02:01:45.828 --> 02:01:50.039
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

02:01:50.291 --> 02:01:54.335
As for me, I'll be a knight.

02:02:01.509 --> 02:02:03.218
What happens now?

02:02:04.012 --> 02:02:07.012
Well, white moves first.

02:02:07.224 --> 02:02:09.097
And then...

02:02:10.852 --> 02:02:12.097
...we play.

02:02:22.698 --> 02:02:27.739
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

02:02:27.994 --> 02:02:31.529
...real wizard's chess, do you?

02:02:31.915 --> 02:02:34.868
You there, d5.

02:02:49.473 --> 02:02:51.051
Yes, Hermione.

02:02:51.267 --> 02:02:56.343
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

02:03:02.279 --> 02:03:04.770
Castle to e4!

02:03:08.409 --> 02:03:10.698
Pawn to c3!

02:03:55.330 --> 02:03:59.327
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

02:03:59.584 --> 02:04:04.292
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

02:04:04.922 --> 02:04:07.247
Then you're free to check the king.

02:04:07.466 --> 02:04:10.170
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

02:04:10.804 --> 02:04:15.465
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

02:04:15.683 --> 02:04:19.431
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

02:04:19.646 --> 02:04:23.229
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

02:04:23.734 --> 02:04:26.485
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

02:04:36.745 --> 02:04:39.663
Knight to h3.

02:05:00.602 --> 02:05:02.595
Check.

02:05:31.758 --> 02:05:33.549
Ron!

02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:39.549
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

02:05:54.614 --> 02:05:55.894
Checkmate.

02:06:15.844 --> 02:06:18.334
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

02:06:18.554 --> 02:06:22.421
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

02:06:22.641 --> 02:06:24.514
I have to go on.

02:06:25.018 --> 02:06:30.938
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:33.640
Not as good as you.

02:06:34.486 --> 02:06:39.314
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

02:06:40.534 --> 02:06:46.158
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

02:07:24.244 --> 02:07:25.904
You?

02:07:26.705 --> 02:07:30.537
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:33.786
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

02:07:34.003 --> 02:07:37.123
Next to him, who would suspect...

02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:41.254
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

02:07:41.469 --> 02:07:46.843
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

02:07:47.057 --> 02:07:49.845
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

02:07:50.353 --> 02:07:54.517
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

02:07:54.732 --> 02:07:56.938
...I would have succeeded.

02:07:57.151 --> 02:08:00.152
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

02:08:00.362 --> 02:08:02.569
Snape was trying to save me?

02:08:02.782 --> 02:08:08.120
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

02:08:08.329 --> 02:08:12.575
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

02:08:12.791 --> 02:08:15.791
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

02:08:16.378 --> 02:08:21.336
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

02:08:22.259 --> 02:08:25.758
He, of course, never trusted me again.

02:08:26.764 --> 02:08:32.006
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

02:08:32.227 --> 02:08:36.271
I'm never alone. Never.

02:08:36.482 --> 02:08:40.561
Now, what does this mirror do?

02:08:42.153 --> 02:08:44.276
I see what I desire.

02:08:44.822 --> 02:08:49.235
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

02:08:49.452 --> 02:08:51.610
Use the boy.

02:08:52.414 --> 02:08:56.328
Come here, Potter! Now!

02:09:08.430 --> 02:09:12.428
Tell me, what do you see?

02:09:37.584 --> 02:09:39.991
What is it? What do you see?

02:09:40.211 --> 02:09:45.371
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

02:09:45.591 --> 02:09:47.134
He lies.

02:09:47.635 --> 02:09:51.335
Tell the truth! What do you see?

02:09:51.555 --> 02:09:55.932
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

02:09:56.184 --> 02:10:00.182
I have strength enough for this.

02:10:18.373 --> 02:10:21.244
Harry Potter...

02:10:21.459 --> 02:10:23.784
...we meet again.

02:10:24.004 --> 02:10:25.415
Voldemort.

02:10:25.631 --> 02:10:29.581
Yes. You see what I've become?

02:10:29.843 --> 02:10:33.425
See what I must do to survive?

02:10:33.639 --> 02:10:37.766
Live off another. A mere parasite.

02:10:38.435 --> 02:10:41.768
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

02:10:41.979 --> 02:10:45.644
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

02:10:45.858 --> 02:10:49.393
But there is something that can.

02:10:49.613 --> 02:10:55.283
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

02:10:55.661 --> 02:10:57.202
Stop him!

02:11:02.250 --> 02:11:05.001
Don't be a fool.

02:11:05.503 --> 02:11:08.622
Why suffer an horrific death...

02:11:08.839 --> 02:11:12.457
...when you can join me and live?

02:11:12.676 --> 02:11:13.756
Never!

02:11:15.763 --> 02:11:20.554
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

02:11:21.310 --> 02:11:24.595
Tell me, Harry...

02:11:24.855 --> 02:11:28.722
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

02:11:28.984 --> 02:11:31.061
Together...

02:11:31.278 --> 02:11:33.816
...we can bring them back.

02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.948
All I ask is for something in return.

02:11:45.667 --> 02:11:48.787
That's it, Harry.

02:11:49.671 --> 02:11:53.538
There is no good and evil.

02:11:53.759 --> 02:11:56.760
There is only power...

02:11:56.970 --> 02:12:01.098
...and those too weak to seek it.

02:12:01.768 --> 02:12:06.809
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

02:12:07.231 --> 02:12:09.473
Just give me the Stone!

02:12:12.110 --> 02:12:13.273
You liar!

02:12:13.486 --> 02:12:15.610
Kill him!

02:12:39.137 --> 02:12:44.475
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

02:14:29.745 --> 02:14:32.236
Good afternoon, Harry.

02:14:34.375 --> 02:14:38.871
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

02:14:39.088 --> 02:14:45.091
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

02:14:45.302 --> 02:14:50.094
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

02:14:52.433 --> 02:14:56.052
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

02:14:56.271 --> 02:14:59.106
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

02:14:59.316 --> 02:15:02.317
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

02:15:02.529 --> 02:15:07.404
Fine. They're both just fine.

02:15:07.992 --> 02:15:10.779
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:13.955
The Stone has been destroyed.

02:15:14.206 --> 02:15:18.417
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

02:15:18.627 --> 02:15:22.576
...and agreed it was best all around.

02:15:22.797 --> 02:15:26.629
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

02:15:28.678 --> 02:15:34.182
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:37.595
But yes, he will die.

02:15:37.812 --> 02:15:40.268
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

02:15:40.483 --> 02:15:43.020
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and...

02:15:43.235 --> 02:15:47.315
You see, only a person...

02:15:47.614 --> 02:15:51.528
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

02:15:51.785 --> 02:15:56.327
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

02:15:57.290 --> 02:16:00.789
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

02:16:01.002 --> 02:16:06.043
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

02:16:07.508 --> 02:16:12.715
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

02:16:12.930 --> 02:16:15.255
I'm afraid...

02:16:16.684 --> 02:16:20.728
...there are ways
in which he can return.

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:24.011
Harry, do you know why...

02:16:24.233 --> 02:16:28.231
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

02:16:28.446 --> 02:16:33.072
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

02:16:33.617 --> 02:16:36.821
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

02:16:37.038 --> 02:16:40.821
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

02:16:41.041 --> 02:16:45.952
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

02:16:46.797 --> 02:16:50.545
Love, Harry. Love.

02:16:58.601 --> 02:17:02.729
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

02:17:02.938 --> 02:17:07.600
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

02:17:07.859 --> 02:17:11.145
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

02:17:11.363 --> 02:17:14.731
But I think I could be safe...

02:17:14.949 --> 02:17:17.322
...with a nice toffee.

02:17:21.414 --> 02:17:22.956
Alas!

02:17:23.666 --> 02:17:25.789
Earwax.

02:17:41.017 --> 02:17:44.184
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

02:17:45.312 --> 02:17:48.017
All right. Hermione?

02:17:48.691 --> 02:17:50.518
Never better.

02:18:06.335 --> 02:18:08.789
Another year gone.

02:18:09.546 --> 02:18:14.089
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:16.922
And the points stand thus:

02:18:17.136 --> 02:18:22.925
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

02:18:24.893 --> 02:18:30.563
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

02:18:35.863 --> 02:18:37.653
In second place...

02:18:37.864 --> 02:18:42.656
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

02:18:48.334 --> 02:18:50.041
And in first place...

02:18:50.377 --> 02:18:55.797
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

02:19:01.388 --> 02:19:03.594
Nice one, mate.

02:19:07.435 --> 02:19:11.515
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

02:19:11.772 --> 02:19:16.066
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

02:19:16.277 --> 02:19:21.235
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

02:19:21.866 --> 02:19:27.370
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

02:19:27.581 --> 02:19:30.367
...while others were in grave peril...

02:19:31.085 --> 02:19:33.326
...50 points.

02:19:34.253 --> 02:19:35.534
Good job.

02:19:43.262 --> 02:19:49.300
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

02:19:49.810 --> 02:19:55.053
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

02:19:59.695 --> 02:20:01.735
And third...

02:20:02.281 --> 02:20:05.152
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

02:20:05.368 --> 02:20:09.661
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

02:20:10.247 --> 02:20:15.123
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

02:20:23.426 --> 02:20:25.335
We're tied with Slytherin!

02:20:25.553 --> 02:20:31.556
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

02:20:31.768 --> 02:20:35.635
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

02:20:35.855 --> 02:20:38.809
I award 10 points...

02:20:39.025 --> 02:20:42.229
...to Neville Longbottom.

02:20:55.584 --> 02:20:58.999
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

02:20:59.212 --> 02:21:03.755
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

02:21:08.806 --> 02:21:12.174
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:53.554
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

02:21:53.766 --> 02:21:58.059
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

02:22:03.483 --> 02:22:06.768
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

02:22:13.033 --> 02:22:16.782
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.826
This is for you.

02:22:38.602 --> 02:22:40.724
Thanks, Hagrid.

02:22:46.567 --> 02:22:50.980
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

02:22:51.405 --> 02:22:55.866
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

02:22:56.119 --> 02:22:58.788
...you could always threaten him...

02:22:58.997 --> 02:23:01.867
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

02:23:02.084 --> 02:23:07.160
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:11.960
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

02:23:17.472 --> 02:23:20.592
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

02:23:20.809 --> 02:23:22.885
I'm not going home.

02:23:23.103 --> 02:23:25.012
Not really.
